    "biography": "Jorge Lizarazo is the owner and founder of Hechizoo Textiles (2000), a firm based in Bogota, Colombia. Lizarazo originally worked as an architect, which influences both the structural clarity and materials used in his textiles. His design work also benefits from his staff\u2019s diverse expertise in the rich weaving traditions of multiple South American regions. The staff is trained to work with new and unusual materials that complement the often understated and basic textile structure of the textiles. Often, his designs require that man-made materials such as metal wire, nylon, and polyester ribbon are integrated with natural materials such as, silk, agave, cumare and penca. The result of these types of combinations is textiles that are both contemporary and sophisticated.",
