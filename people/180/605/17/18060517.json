    "biography": "Anna Alma-Tadema began her artistic training at a very young age under the tutelage of her father, Dutch-born painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836\u20131912). Anna was the youngest daughter from her father\u2019s first marriage. After his wife\u2019s death in 1869, Alma-Tadema married one of his pupils, Laura Th\u00e8r\u00e9se Epps, who became a respected artist. Anna Alma-Tadema\u2019s debut seems to have been at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1885, where two studies she submitted were \u201cindicative of much promise\u201d (New York Times, May 17, 1885). Another view of Townshend House in Regent\u2019s Park, London, may have been painted prior to 1885, when Alma-Tadema and his family moved to the house formerly owned by James Tissot in Grove End Road, in St. John\u2019s Wood.
