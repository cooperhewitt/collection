    "biography": "Smith grew up in South Orange, New Jersey. She enrolled at Harford Art School in Connecticut in 1974, but never graduated. In 1976, she moved to New York, and two years later joined Colab, an artists\u2019 collective that was devoted to making art accessible through exhibitions. Her works typically evoke the human body. Smith\u2019s first artistic works were screen-printed dresses, scarves, and shirts often with images of body parts. Always pushing the boundaries, Smith\u2019s work is admired for its intimacy and provocations.",
