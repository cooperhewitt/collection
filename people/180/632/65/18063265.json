    "biography": "Ben Seibel, born in Newark, New Jersey in 1918, grew up in Manhattan, where his mother started a shop in Greenwich Village selling her own jewelry and fashion designs. Seibel began pursuing a degree in architecture at Columbia University after studying painting under Louis Schanker and sculpture under Leo Amino. After putting his education on hold for a three-and-a-half year term of service in the Air Force, Seibel returned to New York City in 1945, enrolling at Pratt Institute with a concentration in industrial design. He never completed his degree, instead starting a studio that he maintained alongside a small staff until his death in 1985 at the age of 67. Seibel is best known for his tableware designs, drawing influences from his study of sculpture and travels in Japan. His work in ceramics was prolific and wide-ranging in style, reaching prominence in the 1950s with his Informal and Impromptu lines for Iroquois China.\n\nhttp:\/\/library.syr.edu\/digital\/guides\/s\/seibel_b.htm\nhttp:\/\/www.abenseibeldesign.com\/Bio.html\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iroquois_China_Company\nhttp:\/\/search.proquest.com\/docview\/156280366?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri\/sid:summon",
