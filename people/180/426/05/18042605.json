    "biography":"Eugene Grasset (Lausanne, Switzerland May 25, 1841-October 23, 1917 Sceaux, France)\nBorn in Lausanne in 1841, to a cabinet designer\/maker and sculptor, Grasset studied drawing under Francois-Louis David Bocion (1828-90), a student of Charles Gleyre. In 1861, Grasset went to Zurich to study architecture and later sculpture.  Between 1865 and 1867, he traveled to Marseille and then to Egypt.  These journeys would deeply influence his poster design later in life. Upon his return to Lausanne, he worked as a designer of decorative sculpture. In 1877, after six years in Paris, he began his early work as an illustrator, working with popular stories including \u201cLe Petit Nab\u201d (1877) and \"Histoire de quatre fils Aymon\" (1883).  As his career blossomed, Grasset designed furniture, posters, jewelry, and carpets, among many other forms of applied art, as well as architectural design.  His postage stamps for both France and Switzerland in 1877 gained him great popularity in those countries. Soon after, he focused in earnest on poster design. He was one of ninety-seven artists who contributed to Jules Cheret\u2019s Ma\u00eetres de l\u2019Affiche, the hugely popular Belle \u00c9poque book of posters.\n\nIn the 1880s, Grasset\u2019s popularity had reached the United States, where several American companies commissioned him to produced posters and later, the cover for the 1892 Christmas issue of Harper\u2019s Magazine.  The immense popularity of France\u2019s Art Nouveau style reached the United States in part, through Grasset\u2019s connection to Louis Comfort Tiffany, who used his designs as inspiration for stained glass windows. \n\nGrasset taught at various art schools in Paris, and also exhibited his works at different venues, such as the Salon des Cent (1894) and Salon des Artistes D\u00e9corateurs (1904). The most notable exhibition of his work, however, was when the type foundry, G. Peignot et fils introduced the \u201cGrasset\u201d roman and italic typeface at the 1900 Universal Exposition. There he was also represented by tapestry, ceramics, and jewelry. That same year, Grasset published his influential two-volume book, La Plante et ses applications ornementales (1897-1900).",
