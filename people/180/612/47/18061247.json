    "biography": "Nicolette Brunklaus studied art at the Academy Minerva in Groningen from 1983  to 1988. Afterwards, in 1993, she became interested in furniture and designed her first collection with Lynne Leegte. In 1998 she founded Brunklaus Amsterdam, withdrew her products from the wholesale market, and began self-producing, preferring to keep her production small so that she can experiment freely and avoid the compromises of commercial production.",
