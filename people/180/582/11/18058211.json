    "biography": "Armitage studied painting at the Chelsea School of Art. She looks to nature for themes, taking her first design \u201cAngelica\u201d from plants that grew along a riverbank in Chiswick as inspiration. Armitage grew up in Kew and loved to go to the Royal Botanic Gardens which she liked to recreate in her elegant wallpapers. She was a Master of the Art Workers\u2019 Guild member. In the 1950s and 60s, when amorphic and abstract designs were popular, Armitage focused on an architectural and bold graphic style. \nAfter a two-year stay in India, she began linocut printing, producing papers by hand; but soon after, she resigned herself to purchasing a manual offset lithographic printing press. This allowed Armitage to do large scale printing.",
