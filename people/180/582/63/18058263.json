    "biography": "Dumas was inspired by folk cloth, particularly blue and white resist-dyed textiles of China and Europe. She used the folk language in her own works but without using the method of resist dyeing and indigo; rather, she preferred using new techniques and dyes. Dumas moved to Berkely, CA in 1933 and taught at the University for 20 years.  She was devoted to teaching and her relationship with the University was one of mutual appreciation.",
