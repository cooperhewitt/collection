    "biography": "According to Gail S. Davidson interview of the designer: Fr\u00f6lich started training in 1921 at the Kunstgewwerbeschule in Munich.  She moved to Frankfurt in 1929.  There she became interested in architecture and interior design, specifically interiors for workers' housing--Siedlungen.   Under the architect, Ernst May, as city planning advisor, Frankfurt was a center for the Sielungen movement.  She studied for 3 years at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Frankfurt.  Then she moved to Prague where she lived until 1939, when she was forced to flee to Poland.  In Prague, she was influenced by Friedl Dicker (1898-1944) who worked as an interior designer in Prague from 1934 to 1938.  Dicker had studied with Johannes Itten in Vienna together with the artist\/designer Franz Singer (1896-1954).  Dicker taught Fr\u00f6hlich how to make isometric drawings.  After designing an apartment for the son of a woman in her apartment building, she had many interior design jobs for working class housing.  Three of her interiors were published in a \" to be identified\" periodical (see artist's file). From Poland she fled to London, where she had a job as model maker for Franz Singer.  When she came to the United States c. 1941, she worked first for Harrison & Fouilhoux--she executed the model for a proposed Coney Island Aquarium, Brooklyn, 1940--and then for Raymond Loewy.  From 1948-1950, she taught 3 summer courses in Home Planning and Furnishing at Columbia University's Teacher's College.  After 1950, she became headmaster of the Waldorf School and gave up her career in interior design.",
