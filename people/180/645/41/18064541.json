    "biography": "Greta Von Nessen was born in Sweden in 1900, the daughter of an architect. After graduating from the School for Industrial Arts in Stockholm, Sweden, she married Walter Von Nessen, a German industrial designer best known for his cutting edge, Bauhaus-inspired lamp designs. They immigrated to the US together in 1927, establishing the Nessen Studios design firm in Manhattan\u2019s Murray Hill neighborhood. Greta worked alongside her husband as he gained prominence in the New York design world, his career culminating in the design of a versatile swing arm lamp in the 1927. When Walter died in 1943, Greta decided to maintain Nessen Studios and continued designing lamps in his style.",
