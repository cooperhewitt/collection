    "biography": "As a fashion designer, Helmut Lang is associated with the pared-down, urban aesthetic of the 1990s. He is considered a part of the mid-1990s minimalist fashion movement. He is also known for introducing a new aesthetic to menswear, for which he won the CFDA Award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000. Lang's cerebral approach and sometimes esoteric references never interfered with his ability to produce commercially successful and highly wearable garments. \n\nOlivier Saillard, curator at the Mus\u00e9e de la Mode et du Textile in Paris, writes, \"Lang has reconciled a commercial fashion audience with a highly personal and discreet approach, but one that does not fall into the trap of excessive intellectualizing that sometimes transforms women into an abstraction. He also helped launch a practical uniform for the city whose pants, like a long-legged second skin, have surely contributed to the elastic silhouette that has become part of the 2000s.\"\n\nLang opened his first studio in Vienna in 1977 and relocated to New York in the late 1990s. He was the first New York based designer to show his fall collection before the Paris and Milan shows and is credited with the eventual scheduling shift of New York fashion week to a month in advance of the European shows. In 1999, Prada Group purchased a majority stake in the Helmut Lang company. Lang left the fashion world in 2005, citing a desire for new challenges.",
