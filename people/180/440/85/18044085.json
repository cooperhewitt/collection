    "biography": "Ohr was born in Biloxi, Mississippi, on July 12, 1857.  The self-styled \u201cmad potter of Biloxi\u201d is known especially for his unique ability to create very thin-walled vases on a potter\u2019s wheel and his various techniques for distorting a piece\u2019s shape\u2014e.g., twisting the vase to make an undulating pattern, flattening the opening in segments to get a pie crust effect, pinching the rim and bending it in a bunched ribbon effect, etc.  In 1881-2, starting in New Orleans, Ohr hopped on freight trains and stopped in 16 states to visit every potter he could find.  In 1883, in Biloxi, he built his first pottery. A prolific worker, he is said to have created over 10,000 pots in his lifetime.  Ohr died on April 7, 1918 (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",
