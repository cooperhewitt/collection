    "biography":"Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel was the father of Georges-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel (ca. 1730-ca. 1790), draughtsman and engraver, and Jean-Baptiste Blondel (1764-1825), architect. He first studied architecture with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel and later with Gilles Marie Oppenord. He was elected at the Acad\u00e9mie royale d'architecture in 1754 or 1755. In 1739 or 1746, Blondel founded his own school of architecture. In 1756 or 1762 he was named professor at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale d'Architecture, thus ending his own school.
