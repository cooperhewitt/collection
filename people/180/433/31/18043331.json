    "biography": "Alvin Lustig (1915\u20131955) was an innovative pioneer in developing American graphic design during the 1940s and 1950s. Lustig\u2019s early work in the late 1930s reflects his training with Frank Lloyd Wright. Lustig\u2019s subsequent work evolved to adapt the powerful, visual language of cubism, constructivism, Dada, the Bauhaus, surrealism, biomorphism, and abstraction to designs for book jackets, identity programs, record covers, and interiors. Tragically, he did not live beyond two decades of his promising career as a leading graphic designer and educator.",
