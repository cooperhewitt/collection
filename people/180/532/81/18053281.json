    "biography": "Finnish-American architect and designer, Eero Saarinen, son of Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen and sculptor Loja Gesellius, is a major figure in modern design. He is best known for a number of American landmarks, including the highly sculptural TWA terminal building at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport (1956\u201362) and the soaring, stainless steel Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri (1963\u201365). Like several of his contemporaries, he also undertook furniture design, which presented unique technical and aesthetic challenges, particularly in the category of seating. Saarinen\u2019s furniture designs of the 1940s and 50s were benchmarks for postwar innovations in form, function, material, and production techniques.",
