    "biography": "Rosita came from a family of shawl and embroidered fabric producers and became a creative force in the family business. Drawing from folk art, she was influenced by bold colors and mixed patterns.\nShe and her husband, Ottavio (Tai) Missoni opened a studio of knitwear in the 1940s. By 1955, the Missoni brand was launched and became a household name by the late 1960s when the company began producing dresses, coats, and jumpers.  In the early 1970s, they helped create Milan Fashion Week. By the early 1990s, Rosita no longer was interested in fashion and was succeeded by her daughter, Angela.",
