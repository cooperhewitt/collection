    "biography": "Christopher Dresser (1834\u20131904) held a position of considerable importance in the history of design during the 19th century. His published theories on design were based on the importance of an object\u2019s functionality and the simplicity of botanical forms. Unlike many of his peers, he recognized the implications of mechanized production and integrated an understanding of industrial processes into the development of his designs, which were produced by various manufacturing companies.",
