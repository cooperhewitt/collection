    "biography": "A native of the Pacific Northwest, Tom Kundig comes from a craft-based design culture rooted in the area\u2019s industrial and timber heritage. As an accomplished alpine climber, Kundig is familiar with the rugged outdoors of tall trees, rocks, lakes, big sky, as well as with ropes and other mountaineering equipment, all of which have influenced his architectural practice. His early work as a sculptor\u2019s assistant, fabricating large-scale welded steel sculptures, has encouraged his fascination with jerry-rigged machines and apparatuses to move and balance heavy pieces. And, as a devotee of low-tech solutions and experimentation, he enjoys collaboration with engineers and craftspeople as well as with his clients, whose goals and desires actively shape his projects.\n\nKundig, a partner in the Seattle firm, Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen, was a National Design Award winner in 2008 for his Rolling Huts in Mazama, Washington. Kundig was also a National Design Award finalist in 2005.",
