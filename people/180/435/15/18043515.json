With his father and his brother Johann Israel, he published two popular emblem books: Emblemata nobilitate et vulgo scitu digna (Frankfurt am Main, 1593; Paris, 1895) and Emblemata secularia (Oppenheim, 1611). With his brother he also published the design of a grotesque and quasi-erotic human alphabet (Hollstein, nos 119\u201369). His independent work includes reproductive engravings after such masters as Titian, Marten de Vos, Abraham Bloemaert and Sebald Beham.
