    "biography": "Kristian Vedel, known primarily for his furniture designs, was a student of Danish architect and designer Kaare Klint, founding professor of the department of furniture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Under Klint, Vedel participated in the Copenhagen Cabinet-makers\u2019 Guild furniture exhibitions, and was honored by the Guild as early as 1947. In 1962, Vedel won the Lunning Prize (awarded to eminent Scandinavian designers) in recognition of his designs for original and innovative utilitarian products. Vedel\u2019s designs were greatly influenced by the Bauhaus aesthetic and Klint\u2019s standards of economy, function, and simplicity, and demonstrate a great consideration for material and production process across a variety of media. Although Vedel was best known for his furniture, his output also included product design.",
