    "biography": "Oriole Mill was founded by Bethanne Knudson and Stephan Michelson in Hendersonville, North Carolina, in 2006. The mill offers custom woven and designed textiles with a focus on quality (rather than quantity and speed) in the production process. Oriole Mill is dedicated to making the finest jacquard and dobby fabrics from natural fibers and ultimately hopes to lead a resurgence of small artisanal mills in this once vibrant textile-making area of the country. Knudson also formed Studio Structure with designer Paula Verbeek-Cowart to create their own label within the mill.",
