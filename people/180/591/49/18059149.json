    "biography": "Herbert Matter was a pioneer in the application of photography in graphic design. Beginning in the 1920s, Matter was sensitive to the manipulative possibilities that the photographic medium held for graphic design. Influenced by the photomontage techniques of John   and other German and Russian artists of the Dada school, Matter quickly adopted a visual vocabulary that capitalized on the juxtaposition of images, text, and isolated areas of color or tone. Matter was known for incorporating photomontage into commercial art to produce sophisticated and memorable images. \n\nMatter studied with the artists Fernand L\u00e9ger and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant at the Acad\u00e9mie Moderne in Paris in 1927, after initially studying fine art in Geneva at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. While in Paris, Matter worked with the graphic designer A. M. Cassandre and the architect and designer, Le Corbusier. In 1932, Matter returned to Switzerland where he designed posters for the Swiss Tourist Office\u2014the first of which reflects the influence of A. M. Cassandre. Matter came to the United States in 1936 and designed magazine covers for Harper\u2019s Bazaar and Vogue. Matter worked as a staff photographer for Cond\u00e9 Nast from 1945 to 1957, and from 1946 to 1966 he was a design consultant for Knoll. Matter taught graphic design and photography at Yale and, with his wife, Mercedes, a noted photographer in her own right, continued to explore the possibilities of photography and design.",
