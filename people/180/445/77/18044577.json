In 1935, she met her husband Edwin Scheier who had been working as a supervisor of crafts under the Federal Art Project. They soon took up clay and established their first pottery in Glade Spring, VA. In 1938 they were hired to teach ceramics at the University of New Hampshire. Later, they exhibited nine pieces that won them first prize at the Western Hemisphere Exhibition in Syracuse, NY. In the 1950s, they opened a pottery in Oaxaca, Mexico.",
