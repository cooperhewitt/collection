Stillman joined John D. Ward, Robert M. Stratton and C. St. John Seymour to purchase the business which was renamed Ward, Stillman & Co but also, apparently, Seymour & Stratton. The first two managed the plant, which the latter managed the financial affairs.\nAfter Ward retired in 1841, an engineer named Horatio Allen joined the firm, and the firm's name changed again to Stillman, Allen & Co.  A later name -The Novelty Iron Works company was formalized with incorporation in 1855 .",
