    "biography": "Helena Hernmarck was born in Stockholm, and trained at Stockholm Collect of Arts, Crafts, and Design.\nIn 1964 she moved to Canada where she was inspired by pop culture, and began producing sculptural public tapestries with spun and dyed yarns from Sweden. She produced large-scale black and white pieces that resembled newspapers. Rather than use the Gobelin technique, she \u201cuses as background a discontinuous plain weave on top of which she hand picks a supplementary pattern weft, according to a grid which at one end totally covers the plain weave (soumac stitch) and allows it to become increasingly exposed\u201d (Sigrid Wortmann Weltge, \u201cHelena Hernmarck,\u201d American Craft (December 1999\/January 2000). While the size of her works looks to medieval tapestries, the subject matter is modern and ignores the idea that a tapestry should be flat. Instead, Hernmarck embraces three-dimensionality through color, shadow, and imagery.",
