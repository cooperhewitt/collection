    "biography": "Although less well known than her husband, architect and designer Alvar Aalto, Aino Marsio Aalto was a highly talented modern designer in her own right. She received her architecture degree in 1920 from what is now the Helsinki University of Technology, after which she worked for architect Oiva Kallio. In 1923, she joined Alvar Aalto\u2019s practice and, in 1924, they married. In 1935, the Aaltos, together with art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl and the Finnish industrialists Harry and Maire Gullichsen, established the firm Artek to produce and distribute Aalto\u2019s bentwood furniture. Aino Aalto was Managing Director of the firm from 1941 until her death in 1949. A versatile designer, she specialized in interior design but was also active in textiles and ceramics and showed a particular affinity for glass, whether working independently or collaborating with Aalto. She worked as a freelance designer for the Karhula-Iittala Glassworks from 1932 onward.",
