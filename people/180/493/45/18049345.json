Herrey:\n\nThe architect Hermann Herrey was born in Vienna, Austria (4\/4\/1904) and died in New York (10\/10\/1968).  He was in London in 1938, when the Anschlus occured in Austria.  He gave up his Austrian citizenship and made his way to the U.S., ca. 1940*.  Herrey became a naturalized U.S. Citizen in 1946, and was based in New York.\n\nHe was not a member of the Baushaus, but knew and worked with Bauhaus architects.  He designed the first high-rise garage in Germany.  The garage still exists, located on Kant Strasse in Berlin.  Among his other works are:  a prefabricated house for the Berlin exhibition \"Das Wachsende Haus;\" a Berlin shoe store; the Arthur Schnitzler House [Architecture Review Supplement (U.K., 1936]; shop interior with built-in glass vitrine in the Jacoby 1872 building, Frankfurt (1929-30); stage\/set designs for the London production of Faustus; the Morgenthau house, Long Island; concepts for landfill use in New York (example: Battery Park City).\n\nRe: photos of donor's (Ruth Vollmer) Berlin appartment, showing furniture by Herrey in situ. These were taken by Umbo (photographer's stamp on backs of photos), a bauhaus photographer who documented many Bauhaus designers and architects (Gropius, Mies, others).  (photos are in object file 1982-26-6a,b)\n\nHerrey's papers are in the Crock library at Cornell University.\n\n*note: the boat carrying Herrey's possessions to the U.S. was sunk by a German U-boat.  All of Herrey's things, including many papers and his drawings for the London production of Faustus, went down with the ship.",
