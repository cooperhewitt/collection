    "biography": "After learning to weave, Edith Snow began teaching art classes, first at the University of Kansas, where her father was president, and later at Stanford. She trained under Swedish master weavers, and traveled to France and Italy; then moved to New York City where she trained at Flambeau Weavers. In 1921, she opened a studio with Beatrice V. Abbott called Snow-Abbott Looms and later called Snow Looms School of Weaving and Crafts. Snow was interested in using weaving as a therapeutic aid; she collaborated with doctors to help patients with psychological illnesses. She published a book, Weaving Lessons for Hand Looms, in 1947.",
