She went to Yale's School of Art and Architecture where she trained under Josef Albers, eventually becoming a painting major and one of Albers\u2019s top students. While at Yale she became enamored with Pre-Columbian art and textiles and began a research project that led her to South America and Mexico where she learned to weave from local weavers. She would eventually live and work in many  countries such as Chile, Peru, India, Thailand, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, France, and the United States.",
