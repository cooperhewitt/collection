    "biography": "Henning Koppel was perhaps the most eminent artist attached to the Georg Jensen firm in the period following World War II. Koppel trained as a sculptor and designer at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen and at the Acad\u00e9mie Ranson in Paris, and began working for the Jensen firm in 1945. Breaking from Jensen tradition, Koppel\u2019s silverwork was distinguished by his interest in modernism, made evident in his particular use of abstract and sculptural forms. \n\nKoppel is a pivotal design figure, whose drawings and works are represented in major museum collections throughout the world. He won innumerable awards, including gold medals at the Milan Triennale in 1951, 1954, and 1957, and the ID Prize of the Society of International Design in 1966.",
