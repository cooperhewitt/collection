His designs were first published in Augsberg before 1720 and re-issued in twenty editions. His most sucessful and influential book was \"Werk\"published in parts between c.1715 and c.1730. Each set of six prints covered a different subject such as canopied beds, cabinets, chimney pieces, writing desks and dressing tables, clock-cases, tables and chairs, vases and garden ornaments.
