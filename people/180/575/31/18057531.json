    "biography": "Heath Ceramics was founded by the mid-20th-century ceramist, Edith Heath, who was first celebrated for her Bauhaus-style ceramics in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Heath started the company in 1947 as an effort to combine the simplicity of form and glaze embodied in the work of craft potters with industrially mass-produced wares. She formulated a durable stoneware clay and distinctive glazes for her products. Several Heath dining ware patterns and glazed tiles became classics of the mid-20th-century \u201cCalifornia style,\u201d which emphasized a warm informality and ease of use.\n\nBy the early 21st century, however, the elderly Heath was no longer running the firm and it was experiencing a decline in business. Designers Robin Petravic and Catherine Bailey, with backgrounds in engineering and product design, respectively, became interested in the company and purchased it in 2003.",
