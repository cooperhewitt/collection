    "biography": "Founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Company in Zeeland, Michigan, the firm manufactured high quality traditional wood furniture. By 1919, Dirk Jan De Pree, President of the Company, and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, had become majority stock holders in the firm and renamed it for Miller.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the company explored new products and manufactured furniture of modern design in order to increase sales. Working with designers such as Gilbert Rohde by the early 1940s, and later with George Nelson, Charles and Ray Eames, and Alexander Girard, the company manufactured a number of pieces that are now considered icons of mid-twentieth-century modernist furniture. The company also focused on producing innovative office furnshings and furniture systems. Herman Miller, Inc. continues today to create cutting-edge and sustainable design for both the home and the workplace.\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Herman_Miller_(office_equipment)\nhttp:\/\/www.hermanmiller.com\/about-us\/who-is-herman-miller.html",
