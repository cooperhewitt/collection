    "biography":"David Lance Goines was born in Oregon in 1945. He was drawn to the graphic arts by his interest in calligraphy prior to enrolling at the University of California, Berkley from which he was expelled at age nineteen for participating in the Free Speech Movement.  At the Berkley Free Press he worked as an apprentice pressman and also wrote, printed and bound a book on calligraphy there. After studing in London for a year, he returned to Berkely and opened a graphic design studio.\nGoines purched the Berkley Free Press in 1971 and renamed it the Heironymous Press.  His poster style developed in tandem with his continued pursuit of printing books",
