    "biography":"Richard Haas, famous for his architectural murals, generally done in trompe l'oeil, has created new urbanscapes through his work. One of the best known, \"Brooklyn Bridge\", combines both his artistic and  architectural backgrounds.\n\nOther examples are at 1211 North LaSalle Street on the Chicago\u2019s Near North Side, a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into an apartment building  in 1981. It was used for trompe-l'\u0153il murals as a  homage to Chicago School architecture. One side of the building displays  the Chicago Board of Trade Building, facing, from a distance of about two miles, the original building, almost as a reflection.",
