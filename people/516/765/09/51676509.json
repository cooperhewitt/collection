    "biography": "LaCie (pronounced la-see) is a French computer hardware company specializing in IT storage, manufacturing external hard drives, optical drives, flash drives and computer monitors. The business started as two separate companies, LaCie, founded in 1987 and based in Portland, Oregon, and \u00e9lectronique d2, in France. In 1995, \u00e9lectronique d2 acquired LaCie, and three years later the company adopted LaCie as its worldwide brand. As early as 1991, \u00e9lectronique d2 was hiring designers like Philippe Starck and Neil Poulton, gaining a reputation for well designed computer products emphasizing ergonomics and distinctive forms.  LaCie continues the practice, using the services of contemporary designers today. A number of the company\u2019s products are in the permanent collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.",
