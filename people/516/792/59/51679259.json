    "biography": "Levin is an artist, composer, performer and engineer interested in developing artifacts and events that explore new modes of reactive expression. Through performances, digital artifacts, and virtual environments, often created with a variety of collaborators, Levin applies creative twists to digital technologies that highlight our relationship with machines, make visible our ways of interacting with each other, and explore the intersection of abstract communication and interactivity. Levin received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the MIT Media Laboratory, where he studied in the Aesthetics and Computation Group.  Between degrees he worked for four years as an interactions designer and research scientist at Interval Research Corporation in Palo Alto, CA.  Levin is currently Associate Professor of Electronic Time-Based Art at Carnegie Mellon University and since 2009 he has served as Director of CMU\u2019s Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, a laboratory for research across the arts, science, technology, and culture. A two-time TED speaker and recipient of undergraduate and graduate degrees from the MIT Media Laboratory, Levin was named one of \"50 Designers Shaping the Future\" by Fast Company magazine in October 2012. He has exhibited widely in Europe, America and Asia.",
