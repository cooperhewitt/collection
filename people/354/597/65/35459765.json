    "biography": "Philippe Apeloig (b. 1962) is a French graphic designer and typographer.  Apeloig was educated at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts Appliqu\u00e9s and the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris, where he gained experience in what was then the traditional approach to typography\u2014calligraphy, hand lettering, and metal type.  While still a student, he worked as an intern at the Dutch firm Total Design under the guidance of Daphne Ofreski and Yoleen van der Vouw.  Both Ofreski and van der Vouw were assistants to Total Design founder Wim Crouwel, and they imparted in Apeloig the value of the organizational grid that would become one of the foundations of his personal approach.  Following his graduation, Apeloig worked as a designer for Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris from 1985 to 1987 before traveling to Los Angeles to work with April Greiman.  Under Greiman\u2019s mentorship, Apeloig was encouraged to embrace emerging technology as a design tool.  He returned to Paris to establish his own studio, and has since taught typography and graphic design at The Cooper Union School of Art in New York and the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris.  Since the late 1980s, Apeloig has produced poster designs and graphic identities for the New York Type Directors Club, FIAF (French Institute \/ Alliance Francaise) in New York, Instituto Universitario di Architectura di Venezia (IUAV), Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Association des biblioth\u00e9caires de France (ABF), The New York Times T Magazine, the Ch\u00e2telet Theatre Musical de Paris, La Maison de Photo, Brittany, and Galerie Litvak, Tel Aviv, among others.  Apeloig is a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.",
