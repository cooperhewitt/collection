    "biography": "A division of the Herman Miller furniture company, the Herman Miller Clock Company was founded in 1927. The firm initially manufactured mantle and table clocks in traditional styles, but by 1933 introduced a line of sleek, modern, Art Deco-era clocks designed by pioneer industrial designer Gilbert Rohde, who had been hired by Herman Miller to create modern furniture lines. Rohde designed furniture for the company from 1932 until his death in 1944. In 1937 Herman Miller president, Dirk Jan De Pree turned the clock business over to his brother-in-law, Howard Miller, who renamed it the Howard Miller Clock Company. Starting in 1947, Howard Miller began producing a number of wall and table clocks by designer George Nelson (by then, Director of Design at the Herman Miller Furniture Company). Many of Nelson's wall clocks, such as his Ball and Spindel models, became icons of mid-twentieth century modernism. Production of designs by Nelson and several of his contemporaries continued into the 1980s. The Howard Miller Clock Company is still active today, however the product lines once again favor predominantly traditional tastes.",
