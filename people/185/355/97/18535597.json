She traveled through Europe where she studied handweaving and fabric design. She liked to experiment with color. Kramer opened a showroom on Madison Avenue in New York, and then she and her brother, Boris, began working together under the brand name, Cromwell. During the early 1940s, she accompanied her husband, a doctor, to the Ashford General Hospital, where she launched a training program for occupational therapists to teach weaving. After the war, she opened a studio on Lexington Avenue.",
