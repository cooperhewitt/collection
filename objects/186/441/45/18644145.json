    "description": "The object is a set of pages for a desk calendar known as a one-day-at-a-time design. Two holes are punched in the upper half of the set on the left. The calendar holder (not present) consists of a base, usually plastic, designed to accommodate left and right pages, both of which show the current day\/date. Two horseshoe-shaped metal holders are inserted in the two holes, curved side up; the terminals are then anchored in corresponding holes in the base on both left and right sides. This construction allows the daily turning of the pages.\n\nRecto and verso: A black and white reproduction of a drawing of a baby's features (eyes, nose and mouth) occupies the lower half of the recto. There is no outline of a face enclosing the features. In the upper half, centered, Knoll International\/ 1991 are imprinted; the letters are in small sans-serif type while the numbers are larger and bolder. A reversed image, including the words and numbers, appears on the verso, where M&Co is identified as the designer next to the lower right-hand edge.\n\nWhen opened to any day, both left-hand and right-hand pages show the day and date imprinted across the top, with the numeral in the largest and boldest type. On the left-hand pages, every half hour between eight and six-thirty is listed in numeric form in a column on the left; a dotted line extends from the time all the way across. Knoll International is imprinted, centered, at the lower edge. On the right-hand pages, blank for the most part, calendars of the previous, present and next months are imprinted in a row just above the lower edge. The current date is outlined by a square within the present month's calendar. In addition, holidays are identified in italicized type within parentheses, centered below the day\/ date.",
