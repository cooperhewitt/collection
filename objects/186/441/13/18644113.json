    "description":"Serif-style type is used throughout the stationery ensemble.\n\nLetterhead -  White tinted pale green on the recto and turquoise on the verso, the paper is imprinted Margaret\/ Helfand\/ Architects on the upper left; eight lines of type, comprising the address and telephone number, are imprinted on the lower left. A small incised square, aligned with these two groups of type, is centered at the left.\n\nEnvelope - The envelope color scheme is pale gray on the exterior and salmon colored on the interior. The incised square design of the letterhead is repeated on the verso, left; on the recto, it of course shows on the right, just below the flap. Margaret\/ Helfand\/ Architects, followed underneath by the address on five lines, are imprinted on the flap immediately above the square. When the letterhead is folded in thirds and inserted in the envelope, the turquoise paper is visible through the envelope's square. \n\nMailing label - The design is a variation of that on the letterhead. On the top left of the chartreuse rectangle, Margaret\/ Helfand\/ Architects is imprinted; the address and telephone number, identical to the letterhead except for NY, follow immediately underneath.\n\nBusiness card - Next to an incised square, which is centered close to the left edge, \nPaul\/ Rosenblatt is imprinted. On the right, imprinted in italicized type, and occupying the full length of the card, are Margaret\/ Helfand\/ Architects, followed by the address and telephone number on seven lines,",
