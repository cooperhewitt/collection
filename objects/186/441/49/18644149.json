    "description":"Text, photographic illustration, maps and diagrams comprise the forty-odd, unpaginated brochure, designed to attract prospective tenants. The cardboard, spiral-bound covers simulate a gray linen weave texture and green leather binding; No. 527 is imprinted in italicized type within a metallic gold oval, centered on the front cover. A translucent jacket overlays the cover.  Major themes of the English language principal text, accompanied either by stylized designs in a range of colors within narrow rectangular bands across the top or square shapes mid-page, appear on the right-hand pages. Highlights from the text are translated into six languages on the left-hand pages. Following this sequence of pages is a five-section foldout featuring neighboring buildings, cultural attractions and restaurants, imprinted in tones of black and pale green on translucent paper. Sample floor plans, text describing technical details, a section of several blank pages, headed notes, and a final page headed Louis Dreyfus\/ Property\/ Group complete the design.",
