    "description": "The design features a rectangle centered on a background of stock market listings excerpted from a newspaper. Three lines of type: You Can't Afford to Eat Anywhere Else [italics]\/ Recession Prix Fixe Index [heavy sans serif]\/ New York City July and August, 1991 [fine sans serif capitals] head the center space. The first and second lines are separated by thin horizontal bands. Ten lines showing menu choices are imprinted in the mid-section underneath. An additional narrow band separates this section from details (names, addresses, etc.) about the two advertised restaurants: on the left, Restaurant Florent; on the right, Restaurant Bellevues. The vertical lines separating the columns in the stock market background also serve to delineate the rectangle, left and right, and to separate the Florent and Bellevues sections.",
