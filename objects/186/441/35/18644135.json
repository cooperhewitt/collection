Acme Entertainment Inc, imprinted in smaller sans serif style capitals, is centered just underneath. The address and telephone numbers are imprinted in smaller type in a comparable position, just above the bottom edge. Immediately to the left, focused on these four lines, is an outline of a crook-necked table lamp, with short diagonal lines extending from the shade, signifying lamplight.\n\n1993-151-187b, Envelope - The business name, in identically styled but larger type than on the letterhead, is imprinted in the top left hand corner; the address follows in smaller type just underneath. In the lower left hand corner, a suburban\/ rural style mailbox in outline form, with its flag up and its post abbreviated, is labeled Acme , repeating the type format used on the letterhead.",
