    "description": "This introductory, bifurcated and bilingual issue of Colors magazine shows on its front cover a full-length photograph of a just-born baby, umbilical cord still attached. The baby is held upside down by someone, conceivably a doctor - the view shows only his\/ her hands and partially, the arms - in green scrubs. The Colors logo, in sans serif bold type, the letters O fashioned like bull's-eyes, appears across the top in bright green; in the upper left hand corner, the tagline, a magazine about the rest of the world, is imprinted in miniscule lower case\n. Radiating out to the sides of the image (in Japanese, on the left and English, on the right) are phrases indicating the international thrust of the magazine:  tribes in new york and breakfast in tibet are two examples, imprinted in a lower case font in orange. \n\nThe design of the inside front cover and facing page, in the upper halves, features a statement of the magazine's mission: what are you doing right now?\/ (we are making a magazine about what\/ is going on in the rest of the world), followed by what time is it\/ (it's 7 p. m. in new york city)\/ where on earth would you like to be? The two pages are divided into full-length columns, delineated thinly in black; in the lower half, photographs of males and females, one to a column, are further identified by occupation, age, and short self-statements. Articles and photographs carrying out the international theme comprise the remainder of this half of the issue through p. 64.\n\nTurned in reverse, so that the back cover is now the front, the remaining half of sixty-plus pages, unpaginated, comprises advertising of Benetton products. The cover is fully occupied by an above-the-waist color photograph of two female models; the black model, on the left, is posed next to the white model on the right; their cheeks touch at the center of the page. They wear patterned drop earrings in their outer ears; black hats, merging in the center and abutting the top and side edges; and loosely woven turtleneck mohair sweaters, each in a different shade of red. The black model has orange fringed hair, which appears to be of synthetic material, above her eyebrows, and smiles with her teeth showing; the white has red hair of the same material, and smiles with her mouth closed. The company logo, centered near the bottom edge, is followed underneath by the issue date. The logo is repeated on the Inside pages, devoted to full-color photographs of children and young adults wearing Benetton clothes. The last page, titled Benetton stores, which is imprinted on a map in tones of green, lists 159 of the company's 6,300 store locations.",
