    "description": "In a wintery setting, a group of Russian peasants return to their home village after World War II. On the left in the foreground, a man is standing on the porch of a timber house, pointing with his right hand to the entrance door of the house. His left hand is placed on the right shoulder of a peasant woman ascending the stairs. In her right hand, she carries a grey sack. Behind her, a boy enters the stairs, carrying his belongings wrapped in a dark cloth. Behind him to the right two women are unloading a sleigh. A girl  is following the boy, holding her possessions in a white cloth. To the left of the sleigh, a man is standing, with an ax in his right hand. On the extreme right, a man is standing behind a pair of brown and grey horses. In the center of the background, a brand-new yellow timber house with brown roof is being completed. Two men with axes in their hands are sitting atop the roof. Another man is standing in front of the facade of the house, between green windows, holding an ax with both hands.\n\nImprinted in margin in upper right corner in red and black: \"Window TASS No. 936.\"\nImprinted below, in upper margin in large black letters: \"WELCOME BACK!\"\nImprinted in black in lower margin: \"There, where battles were fought and fires swept,\/Where we defeated our conquerors,\/ Where our people fought valiantly and heroically,\/ An intensive construction has now begun.\/\/ And people, whose houses were destroyed by the enemy,\/ Are now going back to their home villages.\/ Welcome back to your new home,\/ And may your life be free, happy, and prosperous!\"\n\nImprinted in black at lower right: Artist -- V.
