Poster is all text in bolded or regular blue type.  \nImprinted: \"Women comprise 9.1% of all \"Regular\" AIA membership. (AIA Study) (in bold)\/ How netural are statistics?  Do they function as effect or support?\/ 1.9% of the Regular AIA membership consists of women who head their own firms. (AIA Study) (in bold)\/ Who decides what statistics are to be sought out?  What desires (for enlightenment or repression) do statistics articulate?\/  1.9% of 9.1% of the 56,000 architects registered with the AIA equals 100 women in the\/ United States who head their own firm. (in bold)\/  In many architectural firms, there are no women architects employed, and never have been. (in bold)\/ This is hearsay.  Architect firms are reluctant to cite the number of women they employ or\/ don't employ, either due to the scandal of absence or the scandal of presence.  Like a different\/ species, women create a spectacle wherever they are.\/  In other architectural firms, women architects are promoted slowly and paid poorly. (in bold)\/  For women, these are hard facts, and the absesnce of their record raises questions.\/ In general, there is less professional recognition of women architects and less pay for women\/ architects. (PA survey) (in bold).  Women are believed to be better at designing houses than civic buildings. (PA survey) (in bold).\/ What is the ground for hidden figures?  In masters of architecture programs in the United States, 38% of the students are women.\/  But hearsay evidence indicates that more women drop out of school and a lower percentage of\/ women graduates becomes registered than their male counterparts. (Womem in Architecture\/ Committee research proposals) (in bold)\/ 2% of tenured faculty members in American architecture schools are women (ASCA study) (in bold)\/ \"You know, for every dolllar a man makes a woman makes 63 cents.  Now fifty years ago that\/ was 62 cents.  So with that kind of luck, it'll be the year 3888 before we make a buck.  But hey,\/ girls?\" (Strange Angels, Laurie Anderson)\/ In the Museum of Modern Art's 400+ architectural drawing collection, there will shortly be 4 drawings by women (in bold)\/ Of the drawings in view at MoMA, none are by women.  Nor has that institution ever\/ sponsored a one-person exhibition of the work of a woman architect (in bold)\/  Who needs a new perspective?\"\nImprinted along bottom: \"d\" (in blue square) earsure  P.O.
