    "description": "Aluminum stool of fluid biomorphic form, the slender, curving, tripod legs rising to a roughly triangular, up-turned and slanted seat\/suport with curled projection rising from one side;  the central leg with short spike-like projection as foot rest. The whole varnished in turquoise colored enamel.",
    "justification": "Phillipe Starck, the son of an aircraft designer, has frequently turned to aluminum as an expressive and durable design medium. He created the WW stool as part of a fantasy office environment for the German film director, Wim Wenders. This highly sculptural, organic form, a single piece of sand-cast aluminum finished in turquoise enamel, serves as a stool or a support while standing. The sand-casting technique was used to great advantage, resulting in a long, slender, flowing form. Vitra AG has produced the stool in a limited series since 1992. \nStarck has been designing since the late 1960s, when he worked for various companies including Pierre Cardin. He gained notoriety in the early 1980s when he was appointed to design a room in President Francois Mitterand\u2019s quarters in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. In 1984, he achieved international prominence, virtually overnight, with his design of the Caf\u00e9 Costes and the Costes chair produced by Driade. Since then, he has continued to be regarded as a leader of contemporary French design. His works include full interiors, their furnishings, table-top wares in a variety of media, and utilitarian items such as juicers and toothbrushes.",
    "gallery_text": "The W.W. Stool is a sculptural seat designed in 1990 by Philippe Starck, arguably France\u2019s best known contemporary designer. Starck straddles both the art and design worlds with his often whimsical creations \u2014 his aesthetic tends to emphasize an object\u2019s form over its function, raising questions about whether sculpture has usability (or if design ever lacks it). Throughout his prolific career, Starck has radically re-imagined the hotel interior, and designed furniture and mass produced domestic items characterized by simple fluid forms. This unusually tall angled stool, or perhaps standing aid would be a better term, is part of a set of fantasy office furniture that Starck created for German film director Wim Wenders. The furniture manufacturer Vitra AG produced the biomorphic aluminum stool in a limited edition.",
