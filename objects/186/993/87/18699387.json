    "description": "A blue door opens at left, partially obscuring a framed landscape placed against a gray wall. Black and blue text on right side of blotter with calendar printed in blue at lower right. The blotter\/calendar was a promotional object intended for the clients of the door manufactory. When the month indicated on the blotter ended, the blotter could be mounted on a manual rocking blotter holder, one of a number of assorted objects in a professional desk set.",
    "justification": "Piet Zwart is considered one of the leading figures in modernist graphic design. He became an instructor at the Bauhaus in 1931 and applied the constructivist aesthetic to his graphic commissions throughout the 1930s. He is particularly noted for his integration of photography and text, an avant-garde application of disparate technologies that is now considered one of the major contributions of the Bauhaus to graphic design. Early in his career, around 1911, Zwart designed furniture and interior d\u00e9cor influenced by Hendrik Petrus Berlage, Carel Adolph Lion Cachet, the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte and De Stijl. \nThis blotter calendar is one of four being considered for acquisition. They are in remarkably fine condition and relate to our collection of calendars as well as to our business graphics collection. The blotters were produced for the firm of Bruynzeel, a manufacturer of prefabricated doors and windows. It is significant that a commercial industry dedicated to building fabrication would have been responsive to Zwart\u2019s advanced constructivist compositions. Zwart designed calendars for the firm throughout the 1930s. Zwart\u2019s graphic use of lowercase, sans serif letters contributes to the stark, modernist look. The juxtaposition of photographic imagery, rendered in unnatural colors, makes these objects even more remarkable. \nAmong the examples of modernist graphic design in the museum\u2019s collection are several groups of objects that relate indirectly to these examples by Zwart. The museum has two leaves from a 1942 calendar, executed for the Isaac Goldmann Company, Printers, in New York: one with an illustration by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy Nagy and, the other, a surrealist-influenced composition by George Giusti. In addition, there is a collection of graphic design programs, business cards, and promotional materials from the Viennese firm of Jahoda & Siegel from the 1930s. Although these items are significant in exploring how the graphic vocabulary of the Bauhaus was adapted by progressive graphic designers, neither of the principals of the Viennese firm attended or taught at the Bauhaus. \nDue to his direct participation in one of the most important 20th-century modernist collaboratives, the museum has earmarked Zwart as one of the key designers whose graphic work should be represented in the collection. These four blotter calendars would be the first examples of Zwart\u2019s graphic design to enter the collection and would join objects that document Zwart\u2019s excursions into industrial design, which include a cup and saucer and a covered glass bowl and tray. Other Dutch artists represented in the museum\u2019s collection are Henk Bremmer, R. N. Roland Holst, Theo van Hoytema, Bart van der Leck, Jan Toorop, and Hendrikus Wijdeveld.",
