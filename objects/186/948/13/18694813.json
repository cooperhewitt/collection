Yankwich\/written specially at the publisher\u2019s re-\/quest, is the product of more than a\/quarter of a century writing and\/thinking on the Constitution.\/Judge Yankwich considers the\/greatness of the Constitution to lie in its\/adaptability to the expanding needs of\/a growing nation. In this book, he em-\/phasizes the fundamental ideals which\/underlie the Constitution \u2013 Freedom and\/Equality \u2013 traces their origin and their\/expression in the Constitution as writ-\/ten, showing the influence which the\/Constitution has had, and still has, upon\/the evolution and development of Amer-\/ican ways, habits, and customs.\/An opponent of totalitarianism of\/any type, right or left, whether it calls\/itself Fascism, Communism, Nazism or\/Falangism, Judge Yankwich has stressed\/in this volume the importance of indiv-\/idual rights which totalitarianism de-\/nies.\/THE NATURE OF OUR FREEDOM\/demonstrates how such a belief can be\/reconciled with progressive liberalism\/which seeks to accomplish the common\/good, and which, ever since the May-\/Flower Compact, has characterized Amer-\/ican aims.\/BEHIND IT ALL LIES AN UNBOUNDEN\/FAITH IN THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND\/ITS FUTURE.\/Watling and Company\/Research Publishing Company\/Los Angeles 13, California\/Photograph of wooden eagle figurehead courtesy\/of Mariner\u2019s Museum, Newport News, Virginia.\n\nPrinted in black ink, inside flap of back cover: The Author, Judge Leon A.
