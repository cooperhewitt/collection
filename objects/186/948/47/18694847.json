Although\/personal and intense, they are planned with a dec-\/orative logic, usually lacking in works of any expres-\/sive power.  This highly personal frontier work in the realm of form, unhampered by too finished a tech-\/nique, makes an unwitting contribution to the imper-\/sonal tradition of the designer or architect, that, is to\/me most valuable.  Sensitive and far from \"primitive,\"\/these small paintings carry large lessons for the more finished painter.\/Alvin LUSTIG\/AMERICAN CONTEMPORARY GALLERY\/6727 1\/2 HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, HOLLYWOOD; in black, upper right corner:  SEC. 562, P.L. & R.",
