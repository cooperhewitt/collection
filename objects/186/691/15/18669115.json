    "description": "Wide circle of flexible, loosely-woven, fine wire strung with numerous bits of pharmaceutical blister packs for pills, each pack composed of clear plastic and colorful foil.",
    "justification": "This large necklace or shoulder piece, Vitamin Store, by Verena Sieber-Fuchs, is made of small square pieces from medical blister packs, loosely woven, like beads, on thin metal wire. The effect is quite delicate and jewel like, though the materials suggest an element of social commentary.\nSieber-Fuchs studied textile design at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel and Zurich and worked in the textile field before becoming interested in jewelry. Her jewelry has been exhibited in many galleries and museums throughout Europe, including Gallery RA in Amsterdam, the Electrum Gallery in London, and the Musee d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire in Geneva. Her works are in the permanent collections of the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris, the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Frankfurt, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, among others. Sieber-Fuchs has a special interest in beadwork which, similar to her career, bridges textile and jewelry design. \nIn addition to traditional glass beads, Sieber-Fuchs has also incorporated such unconventional materials as tiny bits of unexposed photographic film and chopped-up newspaper financial pages into her jewelry designs. Sieber-Fuchs is based in Zurich, a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing, so it is not entirely surprising that she should turn to pill packaging for its possibilities in texture and ornament. The reflective surfaces of the blister pack fragments in this necklace are used to great effect, and the sharp edges of each cut out piece lends a stimulating feel to the piece. The woven structure allows the necklace to fall gracefully on the shoulders and move in concert with the wearer. The discovery that the necklace is made of pill packaging is a witty and poignant commentary on one of the major preoccupations of the late 20th-century industrialized world.\nThis would be the first example of a jewelry piece by this innovative designer in the museum\u2019s collections. This particular piece would be an especially fine addition, for its elegant design, its clever use of materials, its timely social commentary, and its combination of jewelry and textile techniques.\na",
