    "justification":"In 2001, Maharam, a fourth generation family textile company, approached textile designer Hella Jongerius with an open objective to create a single textile which would permit a suite of chairs around a table to be cousins, meaning that each is unique but they all appear to be related. Jongerius' design vocabulary, playing on the concept of random order, personalization of industrial processes, and manipulation of traditional manufacturing methods and materials lent itself ideally to this concept.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis collaboration resulted in Repeat, a set of patterns designed by Jongerius, which introduces new dimension and context to upholstery textiles. Comprised of a series of patterns of singular theme seamlessly flowing into one another yard after yard, Repeat Classic is a repeat of jacquard motifs, while Repeat Dot is a modernist sequence of varied circular forms. In this textile, Repeat Dot Print, Jongerius embellishes further, combining the industrial vocabulary of the weaving process with a layer of white lacquer overprint. Repeat Classic, Repeat Dot and their overprinted variations are each available as panels in unique colorations. A series of four elements drawn from Repeat Classic and Repeat Dot is offered in a range of colors, providing the opportunity to mix, match or mismatch. Through the unexpected use of pattern and exaggerated scale, the Repeat series creates random order as fabric meets furniture with a predictable yet uncertain result.",
