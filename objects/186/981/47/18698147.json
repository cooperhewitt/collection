    "description": "Cuff-type bracelet of five hinged, aluminum sections embellished with brass and gold; the large central section showing two winged cherubs amidst ribbons, garlands and scrollwork, floating above an oval cartouche containing an open-work gold panel with the scrolling, intertwined initials 'MJ' or 'MJC'; the central section flanked by smaller sections of strapwork and scrolls, the section on the left showing a bird and snake, the one on the right with a lizard and snake; the two outer sections of strapwork and scrolls, with attached catch and housing; the hinges, catch and housing of gold.",
    "justification": "This elaborate, highly sculptural bracelet appears to be an early example of aluminum jewelry. First discovered and isolated in 1825, aluminum was still a rare and expensive metal in the 1850s and 1860s. Intricate bracelets, like this example, were produced as luxury items by many notable Parisian jewelers. During that time, aluminum was often combined with other more precious and expensive materials, such as gold and gems, in ways that required intensive labor and exacting workmanship. Aluminum and gold could not be soldered easily and instead required riveting. The rivet heads, as seen in the small beads and flower buds in this bracelet, were made into a design feature.\nThis bracelet is attributed to Honor\u00e9-S\u00e9verin Bourdoncle, a successful chaser and one of the most famous jewelers to produce aluminum objects. He was awarded medals at the French Expositions of 1855 and 1877. Emperor Napoleon III, a proponent of new materials, technologies, and entrepreneurship associated with technological advances, was among Bourdoncle\u2019s clientele. Aluminum\u2019s life as a precious metal came to an end after the 1860s, when metallurgists devised methods to produce it in large commercial quantities, thereby reducing the cost of the material.\nThe bracelet proposed for acquisition relates to early aluminum jewelry in the museum\u2019s collection: a suite of brooch, earrings, and cuff studs with elaborate gold mounts and bright-cut geometric patterns (1928-5-3-a,b and 1928-5-4-a\/c). This bracelet offers a stylistic contrast, however, as the sculptural decoration is in a more romantic mode\u2014the figures, strap-work, and foliage motifs were probably inspired by 16th- and 17th-century design. This bracelet would be a significant and desirable addition to our holdings of 19th-century jewelry.",
