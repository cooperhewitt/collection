Weighing ten pounds and having its own case, this typewriter was advertised as the perfect graduation gift. Designed by Marcello Nizzoli for Olivetti, the Lettera 32 was an innovative new product for the Italian typewriter manufacturer; its portability made it a popular choice for students as well as writers who appreciated its compact design. During the 1960s \u2014the Lettera 32 was designed in 1963 \u2014 designers worked for Olivetti on a part-time basis, as it was thought that full-time employment would crush creativity, and spent much of their time away pursuing other projects. Consistency of style was not important and uniqueness was encouraged from its rotating roster of designers: Mario Bellini, Ettore Sottsass Jr., and Michele de Lucchi.",
