In addition, a large dump truck and several more brightly colored areas have been incorporated into the design.  At lower left, a large letter \"B\" (in blue); the letters \"he\" (also in blue) at lower right, but with the addition of the letters \"le\" inserted at bottom of sheet. This poster is related to another poster (see 1997-19-187), but with additional images and letters.",
