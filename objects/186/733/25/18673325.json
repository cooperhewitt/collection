    "inscribed":"Imprinted in white upper right: Citicorp Center was just a dream in 1968 \/ when the land package destined to be its \/ site was being assembled.  Like all dreams \/ the details were obscure.  But one thing \/ was certain: St. Peter's Church, which \/ had stood on the corner of 54th Street and \/ Lexington for over 70 years, \/ would have a new home on that same \/ corner. \/\n2nd paragraph in white: Facing the Lexington Avenue side of Citibank's building at 399 Park Avenue, excavation of Citicorp Center's site was \/ begun in April, 1974.  To reach sound rock \/ on which the main tower is to stand, it \/ was necessary in some areas to dig down \/ fifty feet below grade.  Though completion \/ is not scheduled before early 1977, con- \/ struction is already transforming the char- \/ acter of the block bounded by Lexington \/ and Third Avenues and 53rd and 54th Streets, as well as the surrounding area.",
