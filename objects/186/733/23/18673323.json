It's a \/ rare visitor who is not thrilled by the \/ breathtaking sight of New YOrk City's sky- \/ line. And as each building has gone up, it \/ has a profound effect on its environ- \/ ment. So it is with Citicorp Center, the \/ single most important project now under \/ construction in the city, which will revital- \/ize the area surrounding it by creating a \/ dynamic new business and cultural center \/ on the east side of midtown Manhattan. \/ \nArchitect Hugh Stubbins' unique design \/ of the main tower building makes \/ possible the mixing of Citicorp Center's diverse parts: three buildings, including \/ St. Peter's Church, and two pedestrian \/ areas. The main tower will be the third \/ tallest building in midtown, fifth tallest in New York City, and, upon completion, will \/ become a landmark like the Chrysler and \/ Empire State buildings south of it.",
