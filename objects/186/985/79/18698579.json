    "provenance":"From the General Henry Knox Mansion in Thomaston, Maine. General Knox served under George Washington as first Secretary of War, and in 1796 built his home in Thomaston, planning the rooms around a large square hall. Further changes were made only a few years ago and the plaster was removed from this niche, and the shell paper was discovered beneath the plaster. It had evidently hung there, plastered over, for at least 100 years.",
