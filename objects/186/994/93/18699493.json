    "description": "Roughly rectangualr stool made of laminated strips of corrugated cardboard cut to form compressed, repeating upright S-curve; masonite layer on left and right sides; slight contour in surface of seat.",
    "justification": "The Wiggle stool is from architect Frank Gehry\u2019s Easy Edges furniture series. In creating his laminated cardboard furniture, Gehry said his intent was to make \u201cthe Volkswagen of furniture\u201d by utilizing a material that was inexpensive and easy to work with.[1] Rather than folding cardboard into boxy forms, however, Gehry was inspired by the layered construction of architectural models and worked with the material in laminated layers as if it were a solid. He used the exposed edges as his surface, achieving a highly textural effect. Gehry devised a construction method and an efficient die-cutting manufacturing system that allowed him to create a wide range of shapes, including the ribbon-like forms seen in the compressed curves of the Wiggle stool. Gehry\u2019s cardboard furniture could be produced quickly and sold at low prices.\nThis stool relates to two examples of Gehry\u2019s laminated cardboard seating held by the museum at the time of proposed acquisition: a side chair (1988-79-1) and a lounge chair (1988-79-2). The Wiggle stool\u2019s form is far less conventional in comparison, with its whiplash curves. The three pieces together would provide a good range of seating forms that could be achieved through Gehry\u2019s cardboard construction and manufacturing methods.\n[1]\u201cGiants of American Design,\u201d House Beautiful, June 2006.",
    "gallery_text": "The 1972 Wiggle stool was an environmentally sustainable design before sustainability became a widely recognized approach in the design industry. Frank O. Gehry, known for his rough architectural sketches, constructed the stool out of layers of corrugated cardboard, making it a stool that can be recycled. Resembling pieces of ribbon candy, the stool's upright wiggly cardboard shapes make a durable and strong seat once they are affixed to each other. Gehry chose to work with cardboard because of its low cost and relative ease to manipulate; the layering of materials that often occurs during the construction of architectural models inspired him. Part of the designer\u2019s \u201cEasy Edges\u201d series, this piece of furniture (along with lounge and side chairs) could be produced quickly and sold relatively cheaply. The curves of the stool are a trademark of Gehry\u2019s style; his buildings often have rounded, twisting exteriors. Gehry founded his architectural practice in 1967 in Los Angeles, the home of his innovative Walt Disney Concert Hall.",
