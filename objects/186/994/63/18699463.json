    "justification":"Tsugihagi was designed by Reiko Sudo (b. 1953), one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers, and&amp;nbsp;co-founder of NUNO, which in 1996 began working with various kinds of embroidery techniques to create new effects. Tsugihagi&amp;nbsp;(1997), is a combination of embroidery and collage techniques made with remnants of Nuno fabrics that are laid out to cover the surface of a base fabric. The remnants are stitched down by sewing machine, and the base fabric is dissolved away leaving a lacey and net-like patchwork of different fabrics. It can be used as a window covering or for other interior purposes. This type of embroidery technique in which the ground fabric is destroyed began in the early 1880s when animal fibers were more than likely used because they could dissolved by a solution of caustic soda or potash, leaving the embroidery thread of vegetable fibers intact.\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;",
