    "description": "Long length of polyester which is folded in the 'mountains and valleys' origami pattern. Pieces of dye transfer paper are inserted between the folds at the edges. The folds are permanently pressed in and the dye transfer effected in one step. The dye permeates the folds to varying degrees.",
    "justification": "Origami Pleat was designed by Reiko Sudo, one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers. Educated at Musashino Art University, she and Junichi Arai were the co-founders in 1984 of the Japanese company and store, NUNO, which produces textiles of extraordinary ingenuity and beauty. Sudo and the other designers at NUNO combine tradition and advanced technologies with remarkable creativity, which led them to the forefront of textile design field.\nOrigami Pleat is a contemporary interpretation of centuries-old hand pleating. It is made by folding the polyester fabric at sharp, crisp angles\u2014like origami (the Japanese art of folding paper). Its color gradation is achieved by sandwiching colored dye-transfer paper between the fabric and outer paper during the heat-transfer process. This process not only transfers the colors, but permanently presses the pleats. At the time of proposed acquisition, the special pleating process is patent pending.",
    "gallery_text": "Reiko Sudo is co-founder of NUNO, Japan\u2019s most consistently creative and innovative textile firm. Origami Pleat is a contemporary interpretation of centuries-old hand pleating. Polyester fabric is sandwiched between paper pleating forms folded at sharp, crisp angles in the traditional \"hills and valleys\" origami pattern. The folded fabric is layered between sheets of colored dye-transfer paper and then goes through a heat-transfer process. The unpredictable passage of the dyes through the layers of folded fabric creates the subtle color gradation; the heat-set process also permanently presses the pleats. The perfectly flat finished object opens to reveal a three-dimensional form full of movement and vitality, yet ready to collapse at a touch.",
