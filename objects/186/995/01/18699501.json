    "justification": "This collection of ribbons is an example of work by the textile artist Laura Forest Nicholson, who is also known for her hand-woven brocaded tapestries. In these vibrant, humorous and graphically appealing ribbons, she creates movement and exuberance using units of repetition. She interprets the ribbon as \u201cthe industrial equivalent of the tapestry: an ornate and often elaborate woven textile with its only function being to provide decoration, richness, and a sense of delight.\u201d Her ribbons are designed in the same playful spirit as her tapestries, an example of which is \u201cEverything for the Garden\u201d (1996-78-1), also in the Cooper-Hewitt collection. \n&amp;nbsp;\nThese ribbons serve as a wonderful compliment to the Textile Department\u2019s earlier collection of ribbons and ribbon sample books. Nicholson\u2019s ribbons are unique in the contemporary world of ribbons in their sophisticated playfulness and offer a light-hearted and visually appealing counterpart to the often seriously elegant designs of most ribbons today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ",
