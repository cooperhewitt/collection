One small inversed photo reproduction of rock at top right.  Black and white photo reproduction of satellite with sphere superimposed at bottom left.

Imprinted in black, at top right: \"Architecture can punch a hole in your sky\".  Just above center, in three text boxes: \"At Sci-Arc people do move than they talk about.  Architecture is more than a talent or a profession.\/ It is a way of living\" (first box); \"What is unique about Sci-Arc is the diversity of its faculty and students.  Together they teach me that\/ excellence is never singular but of many.  This assurance breeds complete creative freedom\" (second box); \"Sci-Arc is a place that fosters inquires into the essence of architecture, an architecture that is strong\/ individually and collectively, an architecture that produces a feeling of acceleration and pleasure\".  \nImprinted vertically in black, inside yellow text box: \"Los Angeles California 90066\".  Just below center, in three text boxes: \"Sci-Arc is a vacant lot where you can build a fort.\" (first box); \"Sci-Arc is an atmosphere in which faculty and students are encouraged not to fear failure\/ but instead to fear not taking chances.\" (second box); Architecture fills our deep epistemic need to  understand and provide at least a general sense\/ of one's place\/placeness in the universe.\" (third box). \nVerso: Text throughout explaining institute's philosophy, projects, programs, and education.",
