    "description":"A side of a building with five Doric pilasters, portico, and one Doric column.  A Doric frieze contains metopes of masks and vases. At right and left corners of the base supporting the building are two urns, each entwined by a snake.  At left, a tree grows on a boulder near a path; at right - an abundance of trees and foliage. Czar Paul I (r. 1796-1801) was assassinated in March 1801.  His widow, the Empress Maria Feodorovna, commissioned this mausoleum from Thomas de Thomon, a French architect working in St. Petersburg between 1799 and 1813.  The building still stands today on the grounds of Pavlovsk Palace.",
