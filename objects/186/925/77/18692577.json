    "description": "Five cartouche-like fields of bold ornament based on North West Pacific Indian motifs.  At upper left a mask-like face on its side, in large horizontal field, at lower left a similar mask facing the viewer in large horizontal field. Along right edge, a thin vertical field, resembling totum pole, with two vertical and one square motif inside.  A small vertical cartouche at center left and a small horizonal cartouche at center. This design makes one full repeat.",

    "gallery_text": "Sculptor, painter, and designer Angelo Testa was a pioneer of dynamic, linear textiles in the postwar period, and contributed to the rise of modern printed textiles in both the US and Europe. His compositions are abstract, geometric, and often playful, adding touches of humanity to the strict functionalism of the International Style design of the time. In the early 1940s, he studied under esteemed designers L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and Marli Ehrman at the New Bauhaus at Chicago\u2019s Institute of Design, who taught theories of universality, geometry, and non-ornamental design. However, contradicting the Bauhaus ideal of cohesive form and function, Testa often designed for screen- or roller-printed textiles rather than for woven compositions. As early as his student days, he had formulated a theory on textile design: \u201cTexture should be emphasized where the decorative function of the fabric is minimized, and color and form where the function is purely decorative.\u201d This theory can be seen in \u201cIndian Heads,\u201d where the repeat patterns harmonize with surrounding white space. Designed while still a student in 1942, the work attests to Testa's early success: the textile appeared in a 1948 Arts & Architecture article, and was manufactured by prominent manufacturer Knoll Associates.",
