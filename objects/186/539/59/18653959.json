    "gallery_text": "Joanne Segal Brandford\u2019s knowledge of netting and basketry techniques was greatly enhanced by her work as a scholar and curator of ancient and ethnographic textiles. Inspired by traditional examples in museum collections, Brandford began experimenting with netted structures in the late 1960s. She was interested in treading the line between visible and invisible, between light and shadow. Some nets she displayed in the round as diaphanous sculptures suspended from one or several strings. Others she framed with multiple taut strings and affixed to the wall. These, she called \u2018drawings\u2019 because of the shadows they cast on the adjacent wall. \n \nWhen Brandford created this piece in 1989, she had recently completed a contract as research historian for the Herbert F. Johnson Museum\u2019s traveling exhibition, Knots and Nets, which also included several examples of her artwork. The exhibition combined ancient and contemporary examples of knotted netting, reflecting Brandford\u2019s own practice, which merged research and art.",
