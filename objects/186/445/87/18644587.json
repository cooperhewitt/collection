    "description": "This black and white photographic reproduction features a frontal view of Andy's Food Mart, a small supermarket, stretching almost completely from side to side. Advertised merchandise, with prices, plasters the whole of the storefront window. Above the store sign, a clock, set at ten minutes to one [P.M.], and labeled Cott [beverage manufacturers], is attached to the roof at the center. To the left is a partial view of a house, apparently clad in aluminum siding; to the right, a partial view of a false stone front structure. A sidewalk stretches out in front; a view of the roadway occupies the remainder of the space to the bottom edge.\n\nThe scene, photographed on a bright, cloudy day, appears to be set in a New York City outer borough or a small town, far from dense urban life.",
