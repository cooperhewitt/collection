    "description": "Two men and five women, wearing flannel or wool nightclothes (pajamas, nightgowns, and robes) are posed in three rows in a family-style photograph within a domestic Christmas setting. In reality, they are M&Co colleagues. Top row: Tibor Kalman, with a pipe in his mouth, wears a predominantly red plaid robe; next to him, on the right, a smiling Carol Bokuniewicz, with Kalman's arm around her at shoulder level, wears a bathrobe of identical material. Middle row, left to right, all kneeling: K. C. Witheral, smiling, with a big red bow atop her shoulder length hair, wears a patterned nightgown with a lace-trimmed yoke; Larry Kazal, leaning toward the right, with an intense, but dazed, expression, wears a dark-toned plaid robe, open in the center, over black and white striped pajamas; Myra Kalman, smiling, her hair in two ponytails out to the sides, wears a white flannel nightgown with ruffled collar and yoke. Bottom row, left to right, seated on the floor: Barbara Mattes, unsmiling, her legs bent at the knees and feet crossed, wears red pajamas trimmed in red plaid, and wraps her arm around a brown and white dog; and completing the group, Maggie Saliskie, tentatively smiling, her long hair bound in a light colored ribbon, her legs crossed on the floor, wears patterned light colored pajamas.\n\nTo the left of the group, there is a partial view of a Christmas tree, decorated with red metallic ball ornaments and tinsel; several gift wrapped boxes are on the floor below the tree. On the right, behind Myra Kalman, is a partial view of a fireplace, logs within, and on the mantel, red candles emerging from evergreen branches, and hung below, Christmas stockings (probably felt) in red with white trim.",
