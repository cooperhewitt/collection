    "justification":"The Lindy Hop was a swing dance phenomenon, but the Finnish Hop? \n&amp;nbsp;\nThis lively design was produced by the artists\u2019 collective know as The Folly Cove Designers, for its location near Gloucester on the Massachusetts coast. Many Finnish immigrants had settled there, attracted by skilled work in the granite quarries or boatbuilding industry. At least half a dozen Finnish immigrants or Finnish-Americans were members of the collective, including Eino Natti and Aino Clarke, who produced large numbers of textile designs.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe group\u2019s founder, Virginia Demetrios, is better known as Virginia Lee Burton, author and illustrator of such beloved children\u2019s books as 1943 Caldecott-award winner The Little House: Her Story and Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel. She was trained as a dancer, and many of her textile designs focus on the body in motion, whether dance-themed designs, or more unexpected physical endeavors, including boxing (Double Knockout), calisthenics (Reducing), even the rigors of the linoleum block printing process used to create the original designs (Folly Cove Designer). While the human form is not as prominent in the work of the other designers, vitality and a sense of movement is common to the output of this unique collective. ",
