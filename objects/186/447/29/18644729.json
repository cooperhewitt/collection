    "description":"Recto: The central feature of the design is a reproduction of a portrait painting of the head, upper body and arms of a chimpanzee, positioned toward the left against a deep red background within an ornately carved, two inch gold frame, also reproduced from the original.  The area around the subject's partly opened mouth is highlighted and he appears to be smiling. His eyes are shining. He holds a small purple flower on a green stem, extending upward to the right, in his right hand. The fingers of his left hand are bent toward his right. To the right of the chimpanzee's head is a laurel wreath, open at the top, with the album title in small upper and lower case letters imprinted within. Talking Heads in somewhat larger capitals is centered below.\nVerso: Natural light, its source not seen, picks out highlights in the photographic background of dense vegetation and a still body of water, as well as in the zigzag arrangement of the song titles, one to a line. These are imprinted in small capitals beginning in the center, about a third of the way down from the top edge, and continuing into the lower third.",
