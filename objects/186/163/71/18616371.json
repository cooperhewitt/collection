In the lower right corner, Adam and Eve flank the Tree of Knowledge, with the inscription: The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. \nIn the center is a four-verse hymn: \nHOW beauteous are their feet,\nWho stand on sion's hill;\nWho bring salvation in their tongues,\nAnd words of peace reveal.\nHow cheering is their voice\nHow sweet the tidings are; \nSion behold thy savior king;\nHe reigns and triumphs here.\nHow blessed are our ears\nThat hear this joyful sound,\nWhich kings and prophets waited for,\nAnd sought, but never found.\nHow blessed are our eyes\nThat see this heavenly light,\nProphets and kings desired long\nBut died without the sight.\n\nAnd the inscription, with a curving floral vine border on four sides.",
