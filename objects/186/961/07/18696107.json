    "justification": "We have followed the development of the work of jeweler and fiber artist, Barbara Natoli Witt, and are now pleased to have the opportunity to add a group of her necklaces to the collection. Her work is characterized by hand-woven or knotted collars into which she integrates antique beads and other ornaments.\nWitt studied fine art and graphic design at Cooper Union, and art history at Berkeley. She became interested in textile techniques and taught classes in weaving, rug design, lace making, and macram\u00e9 in the Bay Area, where one of her students introduced her to a collection of antique beads. Soon after, Witt began to incorporate beads, talismans, and amulets into the broad, woven collars of her design.\nWitt\u2019s neckpieces usually begin with a special ornament, or with the interests of a particular client. She works closely with both the object and her client. The whole composition, motifs, and color scheme of a necklace will revolve around the form and meaning of a central antique bead or talisman. Once the nylon threads are hand dyed, Witt chooses the weaving, knotting, or lace-making techniques to best complement the central ornament. Other beads or ornaments are subsequently chosen to strengthen the theme.\nWitt\u2019s clients have included artists, politicians, fashion icons, socialites, and Hollywood celebrities. Among them are Diana Vreeland, Eleanor Lambert, Clare Booth Luce, Pamela Harriman, Dinah Shore, Marella Agnelli, Nancy Marks, and Beatrice Wood, a ceramist who created special ornaments for Witt\u2019s pieces.\nWitt\u2019s work would fit nicely into Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s collection, bridging jewelry and textile design with its materials and techniques. The jewelry collection has other items that incorporate woven or knotted techniques, such as woven steel, jewelry with woven human hair or horsehair, and decorative buttons with lace covers. Witt\u2019s work also relates to more contemporary pieces held in the collection at the time of proposed acquisition, such as the Vitamin Store necklace by Verena Sieber-Fuchs, made of pill casings woven into a broad collar, and a large Tony Duquette necklace with a bold collage-like assemblage of different elements. \nReferences:\nEve Auchincloss, \u201cWoven Jewels: Unique Creations By Barbara Natoli Witt,\u201d Connoisseur Magazine, July 1989, 67\u201371. \nAnne Marie Schiro, \u201cGleams of Found Art Jewelry,\u201d The New York Times, December 2, 1980.",
