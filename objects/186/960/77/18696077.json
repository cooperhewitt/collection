    "justification": "This silver dessert fork, designed by Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann, is from the pattern called Flat Model, the first model produced by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte when it opened in 1903. The original service consisted of 33 different implements and all three of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte\u2019s founding members\u2014Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, and Fritz Waerndorfer\u2014had it made for their own use. Hoffmann\u2019s Flat Model was the most radically modern flatware design introduced at the beginning of the 20th century and it has continued to exert tremendous influence on cutlery design throughout the past century.\nThis particular fork is purported to be part of the first Flat Model service ever produced, was commissioned by Hertha Jaeger, a member of the Magda Mautner von Markhof family. The set descended through the estate of Magda Mautner to the present source.\nOne of the features that makes this set so drastically modern for its time is the stark, flat, rectangular shape, ornamented only by the four beads at the handle terminals. The original designs and maquettes for the Flat Model show straight sided forks for dinner, fish, and dessert.[1] The shape of the fork was altered when the service went into commercial production in 1904\u2014the head of the fork was given a more traditional definition by tapering and then extending the sides of the handle at the base of the fork head. Later Flat Model sets were produced with more traditional fork shapes.\nHoffmann\u2019s Flat Model flatware is a pivotal design in modern cutlery and would be extremely desirable to add to the museum\u2019s collection. It was the first and most radical design to reduce superfluous ornament and break down traditional boundaries between handles, blades, bowls, and tines. At the time, even the most adventurous patrons were not quite ready for this innovation: the Flat Model was only in production for four years. A similar revision is found in Hoffman\u2019s Round Model of 1906. Although the Round Model drawings show a straight sided dessert fork, it was produced in the more traditional fork form. Hoffman\u2019s other cutlery designs for the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte through the 1920s, also revert to more traditional forms.\nThe Flat Model and the Round Model were introduced to the public at the influential exhibition, Der gedeckte Tisch (The Dining Table), held in the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte showrooms in 1906. The Flat Model was criticized as \u201cgeometry, not art\u201d and the service was called \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and \"suggestive of anatomical instruments.\u201d[2] It is difficult to find other contemporary cutlery designs with which to compare it\u2014the Newbery set by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in 1902, with its thin tapering handles, comes close. It would be several decades before European flatware designers dared to introduce patterns with such dramatically reductive forms, such as the 1936 Gio Ponti stainless steel pattern for Krupp and the 1957 AJ pattern by Arne Jacobsen for Georg Jensen. None, however, have had the impact that Hoffmann\u2019s did at the beginning of the century.\n[1] Waltraud Neuwirth and Josef Franz Maria Hoffmann, Josef Hoffmann: Bestecke f\u00fcr die Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte (Vienna: Selbstverlag W.

    "gallery_text": "The avant-garde, modernist design group Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte produced its first cutlery pattern the year of its founding, in 1903. Werkst\u00e4tte co-founder Josef Hoffmann, after 1900, focused on reducing designs to their most functional and rudimentary elements, as he did in his Flat Model set, which was considered radical at the time. The pieces\u2019 flatness, rectilinearity, and minimal ornamentation\u2014four beads, a common motif of Hoffmann\u2019s, at the base of the handles\u2014made them entirely unlike traditional cutlery. The set was first presented to the public in 1906 at the Werkst\u00e4tte showroom exhibition \u201cDer geodeckte Tish\u201d (\u201cThe Dining Table\u201d). It was criticized as being uncomfortable to use, too focused on geometry, and resembling \u201canatomical instruments\u201d rather than flatware. Critics disapproved of the lack of division between elements: in the fork, for instance, the prongs and handle were all one piece. The set was later made for commercial manufacture with slight alterations, notably a tapering of the fork\u2019s sides to give a more traditional, though still undoubtedly modern, look. It remained in production just four years and it would be many years before Europe again saw such pared-down cutlery.",
