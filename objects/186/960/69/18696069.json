    "justification":"\nThis textile was designed by Akihiro Kaneko (b.1961), who received his education at The Rhode Island School of Design. Upon graduating, he returned to his father\u2019s textile business, Kaneko Orimono, in Kiryu, an important textile manufacturing city in Japan, and worked on his own designs in addition to collaborating with various designers including Junichi Arai and Hideko Takahashi.\nFluctuation, designed in 1997, is one of Akihiro Kaneko\u2019s most distinctive textiles.&amp;nbsp; Kaneko combines polyester monofilament with washi or Japanese paper to create a wonderful undulating surface design.&amp;nbsp; Like many innovative designers, he has a keen understanding of the behavior of fibers under certain conditions, such as high temperature, and combines different yarns to achieve the desired effect.&amp;nbsp; In Fluctuation, the textile is shrunk during the finishing process, and because washi and polyester shrink at different rates, the final result is this undulating washi yarn. The finished result clearly demonstrates how the creative hand combined with a command of textile sciences can create a very unique effect. This contemporary work demonstrates some of the best textiles made within the last several years, and provides insight into not only current Japanese technology, but also long-standing textile traditions in Japan.&amp;nbsp; \n ",
