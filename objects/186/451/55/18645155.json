In lower right corner, a solid orange rectangle covers roughly half of this row's width and slightly less than half of its height. Superimposed over the row of lines and solid rectangle is a vertical row of thick horizontal black bars. Bars alternate randomly between ones made of smaller black lines and ones rendered in solid black. Solid black bars end at right in a diagonal. Dispersed amongs horizontal bars between the vertical rows of orange lines are small black rectangles.",
