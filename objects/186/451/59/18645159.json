The fire had died\/And I knew no more from the night\/Than I knew before fear had settled down round my head like hair.\/So I seized the sack, wrapped once more my shoulders\/And returned to the pit; there was nothing there\/Not even a burnt-out coal; but I saw\/Over my head the coals of heaven glowing through the frost\/And a kind of luminous smoke that trails\/From one end to the other of the sky,\/And thought I heard voices in the heaven\/198.",
