    "description":"Issue of design magazine, vol. 47, no. 8\/354. Cover is largely brown with text and designs in black and white.\n\nOn right side of page, an abstracted tree form made of bold white lines runs height of page. The trunk of tree is a single white line. Two additional white lines branch out near the upper part of tree trunk and are surrounded by many identical white \"splotches\" meant to represent leaves. At bottom of tree trunk are three \"roots\" made up of similar white lines. Randomly dispersed over roots are words in lowercase italic serif type: architecture, photography, design, weaving, painting, sculpture, graphic design.\n\nLeft of tree trunk is oval containing aerial photograph of Black Mountain College, a white modernist building surrounded by trees in front of a lake. A white crescent shape borders the lower half of the oval. Behind the tree and the oval is an amorphouse mountain-like shape with four curved peaks. The fourth peak is cut off by right edge of page.",
