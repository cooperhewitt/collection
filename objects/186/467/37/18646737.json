    "justification": "A. W. N. Pugin was the most illustrious exponent of the Gothic Revival in England in the 19th century. The son of an architect, Pugin worked for the Drury Lane Theatre, creating stage settings and mechanical designs. At the age of 15, he designed silver in the Gothic taste and&amp;nbsp;furniture for Windsor Castle. Pugin\u2019s firm produced a wide range of designs in the Gothic style, the eccentricity of which bankrupted the firm within two years. In addition to authoring numerous books on design (which predate the English architectural critic and author John Ruskin by 20 years), Pugin created designs for metalwork, ceramics, jewelry, glass, and carpets. \nPugin\u2019s designs are rare. This plate's Waste Not Want Not pattern, created&amp;nbsp;with encaustic inlay, not only expresses his preoccupation with Gothic forms and ornament but also addresses Victorian morality and the ability to teach virtue through design. This example was manufactured by Minton and the design was published in the Journal of Design and Manufactures in 1850.",
