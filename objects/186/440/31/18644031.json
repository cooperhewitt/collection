    "description": "The central image in the upper half of the page is a floor plan of a terraced apartment, overlaying a narrow vertical rectangle. The plan's border is composed of various Memphis-like patterns, such as squiggles and  x or + signs; Apt.\/ 19A is inserted within a break in the center of the top of the border. The rectangle, bordered by three gradually narrowing lines, is placed just off center to the right, and extends about three-quarters of the way down. There are five lines of type in a curved format in the upper section of the rectangle and eighteen straight lines, beginning with the letter I in the Memphis (condominiums) logo style and concluding in the lower section with Memphis\/ downtown, also in the logo style. An angular shape on the upper left and a curved blob on the upper right, each in a different Memphis studio-style pattern, are behind the floor plan and rectangle. On the left, below the floor plan, are four paragraphs of additional marketing information, followed by a diagonal, cartoon-like image of the Memphis downtown condominium and the building's address.",
