    "description":"A cartoon-like sketch of the Memphis (condominiums) downtown building is placed on the diagonal, upper right to lower left, in the center of the page. The accompanying type, consisting of the heading in a curved format, followed by seven lines of copy, is enclosed within a bordered rectangle superimposed on the right edge of the building. A cloud-like smudge is centered near the bottom edge. A narrow, vertical column of copy, occupying the full length of the page, appears on the left, separated from the principal design by a dotted line. The introductory line of copy begins with the capital leter I, identical in design to the penultimate letter of the Memphis (condominiums) logo. Memphis [logo]\/ downtown, followed by the two-line address and three lines of additional marketing copy, appears in the column close to the bottom edge of the page.",
