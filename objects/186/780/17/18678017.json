That Gerard was trained as an architect should come as no surprise - like many architects of his generation, he had experienced firsthand the challenge of finding textiles appropriate for a modern interior.\n \nAs director of Herman Miller\u2019s Textile Division, Gerard sought to create a fabric collection that would conform to his architectural training, combining pure forms like circles, triangles, and squares in appealing configurations. This piece is composed of white rectangles arranged in grid-like patterns against a black ground, suggesting a nighttime view of the Manhattan skyline. The Museum also houses the design for this textile (1969.165.268), produced as a blueprint like those used by architects and engineers.",
