    "description": "Recto: On a cream-colored background, centered near the top edge,  the restaurant name is imprinted in italicized letters. Just below, in miniature lower-case italics, \"soon to be open 24 hours\" appears. The hours of business are imprinted in the top right corner. The menu offerings, in two columns, are imprinted in small capitals and are listed within one of twelve categories, imprinted in italics. Prices are imprinted to the right of the offerings. Four of the five categories in the right-hand column, instead of showing specific offerings, show dotted lines to accommodate daily specials or other insertions. (It is possible that the present object is a mock-up rather than a completed design.)",
