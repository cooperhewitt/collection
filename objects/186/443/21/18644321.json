The image is placed slightly off center side-to-side and equidistant from the top and bottom edges. Close to the top edge of the card is Florent Morellet, in black capitals, followed by and the in lower case. Continuing the message, Society for the Right to Die, just in from the left edge and extending to the right of center, is superimposed on the image in larger black capitals, and five additional horizontal lines of type in smaller letters are interspersed, ending just above the bottom edge.\n\nVerso: blank.",
