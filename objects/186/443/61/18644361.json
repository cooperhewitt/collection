    "description": "In the present photograph, the model, posed right of center in a full frontal view, and probably facing a mirror, is wearing a dress composed of a horizontally striped, long-sleeved, predominantly blue-green top, trimmed in white collar and cuffs; and a cocoa brown, full, gathered taffeta skirt, with a wide white belt, within taffeta loops, at the waist. Pointed, buckled white shoes and daisy-shaped earrings complete the ensemble. Isaac Mizrahi, the designer, standing behind her slightly to the left, with his head and face only partly visible and his gaze focussed on her right shoulder, his arms bent, his hands at her shoulders, and a necklace matching the earrings in his left hand, is perhaps about to place the necklace around the model's neck. Back and to the right, two assistants, one in a pinkish shirt with a green tapemeasure around his neck, the other in black, look straight ahead, probably into the mirror. To their right, a standing coat-tree holds several coats, and in front of that, there are belts in several colors laid out on top of plastic sheeting, covering large cartons resting on the floor. On the left rear side, there is a table filled with transparent boxes of buttons and other trimmings, as well as desktop office items (pencils, Scotch tape, etc.). Beneath the table, several tiers of shoe boxes, labeled Manolo Blanik [shoe designer], are stacked seven across, with the shoes on the top tier exposed. Three people with weary expressions are seated in casual poses at the table. Fashion photographs and sketches are tacked in several rows, almost to the ceiling, on the wall behind. The Isaac Mizrahi logo, superimposed on the floor tiles, appears in the lower left, with Bergdorf Goodman [department store], in smaller type, just beneath. In the surrounding white border, at the bottom, Vogue March 1991 is imprinted.",
