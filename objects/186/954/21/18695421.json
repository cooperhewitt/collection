    "inscribed": "Imprinted on brochure cover, in white:  The\/Graphic Art\/of\/Paul Rand; brochure open, left page, upper left:  IBM is pleased to present an exhibition of\/the work of Paul Rand, one of the most\/innovative and influential designers of the\/twentieth century.  Called by Print magzine \"The first American designser to apply\/the Bauhaus values of simplicity and\/abstraction both consistently and effec-\/tively,\" he is considered one of the\/pioneers of the \"look\" of contemporary\/graphic design.  In the process, he has helped redefine the role of the art director from that of a middle-man, who put to-\/gether the work of others (writer, illustrator,\/letterer, and typographer) to that of a designer of a total concept, concerned with\/both form and content.  In a career cov-\/ering more than thirty-five years, he has\/won international recognition for his de-\/signs for advertisements, books, posters,\/packaging, trademarks, and for corpo-\/rate design programs, as well as for his abilities as an illustrator, writer and\/teacher.; upper right: The nature and quality of his work is\/perhaps best characterized by Gibson A.\/Danes, Dean of the School of Art and\/Architecture at Yale University when Rand\/taught there.  \"At a moment when we are\/surfeited with the mundane and the medi-\/ocre,\" he has written, \"Paul Rand's\/precise, elegant and often witty visual\/statements are like a spring breeze.\/He can make the ordinary, extraordinary:\/the mundane becomes magical.  All of\/this happens with a clarity and intuitive\/logic that makes the compact solution\/seem inevitable because it is right.  Per-\/haps the real touchstone of his imagi-\/native power is his rigorous awareness of\/quality.  Whatever he does somehow\/seems to be a qualitative impovement\/upon what was there before.\"; brochure open, right page, upper left:  Born in New York City, Rand studied at\/Pratt Institute, Parsons School of\/Design, and at the Art Students League\/under George Grosz.  At the age of\/twenty-three, he became art director of\/Esquire\/Apparel Arts and later of the\/Weintraub Advertising Agency.  He has\/taught at Part Institute and Cooper\/Union, and from 1956 to 1969 was profes-\/sor of graphic design at Yale University.\/For many years he has been a consultant\/to several major corporations, among\/them IBM. Paul Rand's achievements have been\/recognized in many ways.  In 1966 he\/received the Gold Medal of the American\/Institute of Graphic Arts.  He received\/a citation from the Philadelphia College\/of Art in 1962, and was made an hon-\/orary professor of Tama University, Tokyo\/in 1958.  In 1959 the book, \"Paul Rand,\"\/by Yusaku Kamekura, was published by\/Zokeisha Publications, Tokyo, and\/Alfred A. Knopf, New York.; upper right corner: Rand's book, \"Thoughts on Design,\"\/which was published in 1947, is being\/issued both here and abroad in re-\/vised form as a paperback this year.  He\/is also the author of \"The Trademarks\/of Paul Rand\" and \"Design and the Play\/Instinct,\" as well as numerous papers\/on design, advertising and typography,\/and has illustrated a series of child-\/dren's [sic] books published by Harcourt\/Brace & World.  Mr. Rand is a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of\/The Royal  Society of Arts, a member of\/Alliance Graphique Internationale, The\/Industrial Designers Society of Amer-\/ica, The New York Art Directors Club, The\/Society of Typographic Arts, and The\/Typophiles.  He is a past member of the\/Fulbright Scholarship Jury, and an ad-\/viser on art education to the Philadelphia\/College of Art and The Museum School\/of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.; on back cover, upper left: \"He is an idealist and a realist, using the\/language of the poet and the business\/man.  He thinks in terms of need and func-\/tion.  He is able to analyze his problems\/but his fantasy is boundless.\"\/...Ladislav Moholy-Nagy\/\"In his work I find constant evidence of\/total dedication, such as can be given only\/by an individual who devotes body and\/soul, capacity and experience to the work\/he has chosen:  a man who is constantly\/aware of what is going on around him, who\/is interested in what others think, and\/who studies what the past can teach him.\/These are the qualities that distinguish\/a grapahic artist from the amateur and give\/his work a claim to nobility.\"\/...Giovanni Pintori, Milan; upper right corner:  \"Paul Rand, by the very premise of his\/work, has been a severe critic of the\/average level in advertising presentation\/and design.  He has proved the value of\/his convictions not by words or theories,\/but by actual work and courage.\"\/...E. McKnight Kauffer\/ \"His simple forms and fresh colors reveal\/a purity possessed only by very great\/art; it is his purity which forms a link be-\/tween his work and the essence of\/Japanese art tradition.  We love Paul Rand\/and his art, not only for their own sake,\/but as a symbol of the freshness and vital-\/ity of American life and culture.\"\/...Yusaku Kamekura, Tokyo; at lower left:  The Graphic Art\/of Paul Rand\/May 18 to June 20, 1970\/IBM Gallery\/16 E. 57th St., New York\/N.Y. 10022\/Monday through Saturday\/10 am-5pm; lower right:  IBM [in black horizontal stripes]",
