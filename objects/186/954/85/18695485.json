    "justification":"Millmosaic was introduced in 1960, while Alexander Girard was head of the Textile Division at Herman Miller, and represents an important period of his work. At the time this particular textile was introduced, Girard was a successful and much sought-after interior designer, and had established an important reputation for himself and for the textiles division at Herman Miller. His work derived from a wide range of sources such as ancient and folk art, however the design for Millmosaic was most likely inspired by his interest in contemporary art, or more specifically, Op art. The geometry of the alternating diamonds and triangles reverberates with the contrasting purple and green color. As an upholstery material, it was compatible with his line of furniture, which sometimes used the same geometric configurations.",
