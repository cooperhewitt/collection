    "justification": "Campagna, likely named after the designer Angelo Testa\u2019s friend, Paul Campagna, epitomizes Testa\u2019s design vocabulary. Designed around 1950 for Knoll Associates, Campagna utilizes Testa\u2019s preferred linear and geometric forms, commonly associated with his Bauhaus training. The hard edges of the concentric rectangles in this textile, however, have been softened by their appearance of being almost hand-drawn. \nThis particular textile is one of the most well-known of Testa\u2019s works and was published in many architecture and design journals of the day. It is indicative of his innovative work as one of the leading American textile designers of the 1940s and 1950s and represents an important moment in postwar America when textiles were a very calculated part of every modern interior.\nTesta was one of the foremost American textile designers of the mid-20th century. In 1945, he was the first graduate of the Institute of Design (formerly the New Bauhaus) in Chicago, where he studied under the artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and the architect George Fred Keck. Although Testa worked primarily in the field of printed textiles, he was also widely known as a painter and sculptor. In 1947, he founded his own firm, Angelo Testa & Co., which remained active until his death in 1984. His clients included such major furniture companies as Knoll Associates and Herman Miller, as well as the textile firm, F. Schumacher & Co. \nCampagna would be a significant addition to the museum\u2019s 20th-century holdings and will also enhance our Testa holdings. This piece is an important example to include for its colorway alone. Testa made variations of Campagna (each also titled Campagna). At the time of proposed acquisition, one of these iterations is in the museum\u2019s collection (1948-119-5). \nTesta made variations of Campagna (each also titled Campagna). At the time of proposed acquisition, one of these iterations is in the museum\u2019s collection (1948-119-5). The variation of Campagna under consideration, an important example for its colorway alone, would be a significant addition to the museum\u2019s 20th-century textile collection and would also enhance our Testa holdings.",
