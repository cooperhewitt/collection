    "justification": "Lawrence Anton Maix was a successful textile producer in the 1950s and 1960s as well as an early American proponent of modernist upholstery and interior furnishing fabrics. He was initially employed by Hans Knoll when Knoll first began his furniture company. During his decade tenure at Knoll, Maix became friends with designers such as Serge Chermayeff, Jens Risom, and George Nelson\u2014some of whom were enlisted to produce textiles for Maix after he started his independent business in 1948.\n \nIn 1949, Maix began to produce textiles under his own name. It was at this point, that he employed Paul Rand and other successful designers, like Alvin Lustig and Chermayeff, to produce a new line of designs called the Campagna collection. The textile proposed for acquisition, Rand\u2019s Abacus, is one of the designs from this collection. It is a screenprinted textile on plain weave in black, blue, and green on a natural linen ground. Its heavy horizontal stripes and narrower vertical stripes with irregularly-spaced ovals evoke the form of an abacus. The design was featured in a number of magazines and was distinguished with the MoMA Good Design award in 1950. Rand first used this design in 1946 on the cover of his book, Thoughts on Design.\nThe museum already possesses a smaller sample of this particular fabric in another colorway. The three yard length that is being offered is extremely rare and comes from Maix\u2019s widow. It is in excellent condition and would be a remarkable acquisition.",
    "gallery_text": "Among the most influential books in the history of American graphic design is Paul Rand\u2019s Thoughts on Design, published in 1947. Covering the jacket of this ground-breaking manifesto of modernist theory and practice is a series of oblong dots arranged in uneven rows, rendered in translucent shades of gray. The image is based on a photogram, made by exposing a wood-and-wire abacus to a sheet of photographic paper. At once abstract and recognizable, the photogram is a direct imprint of a physical object.\nRand used his photogram as the basis of a pattern design as well as for the cover of his famous book. Working with the progressive manufacturer L. Anton Maix in New York City, he created Abacus around 1946.  The play between dark and light, foreground and background, transparency and opacity, endows this simple printed textile with movement and depth, while the pattern\u2019s ordered columns gracefully follow the folds of the fabric.",
