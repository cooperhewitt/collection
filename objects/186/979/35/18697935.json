    "description": "Poster for The Chap-Book, August 1894. A woman dressed in blue at the center of the image stands in a wood, holding a pair of skates. The words The Chap \/ Book, printed in red cover the lower left portion of the poster.\nTwo-color lithograph: red and blue.",
    "justification": "William H. Bradley executed a number of designs as promotional pieces for The Chap-Book, his Chicago-based publication considered to be the American public\u2019s introduction to art nouveau style and the British Arts and Crafts movement. Unlike his contemporary, Louis Rhead, whose influences were predominately French, Bradley looked to England. He was especially influenced by Aubrey Beardsley\u2019s sophisticated illustrations for the The Yellow Book, a journal of art and literature that caused great scandal in London when first published in April 1894. Like Beardsley, Bradley relied on breaking the compositional rectangle into a series of dominant and subdominant lines, filling in areas with flat expanses of one or two colors. \nBradley\u2019s second Chap-Book poster, also known as The Blue Lady, demonstrates the link between the British Arts and Crafts movement and the American adaptation of that aesthetic in graphic design. The influence of the Beardsley on Bradley is evident in this poster. Like Beardsley, Bradley relies on the stark use of the silhouette for dramatic effect, balancing the flat blue and black areas of the woman\u2019s coat and patterned dress with a careful arrangement of thin branches. The dramatic slash of white across the top creates a connection between the frozen lake and the woman\u2019s haughty profile, while the skates, dangling vertically at her side, break up the expanse of blue. Throughout the poster, Bradley creates a brittle effect by outlining the shapes with white, allowing the color of the paper to function effectively as a design element. The use of vermilion for the lettering has a startling effect against the moonlit scene. \nThe posters from this period by Bradley, Rhead, and Edward Penfield, among others, were not intended to be affixed to walls, billboards, or outdoor displays as were their French counterparts. They were instead intended as advertisements sent from the publisher directly to bookstores and book dealers, where they often were sold to poster collectors or favorite customers. Many of these posters were printed in limited editions by the publishers, signed by the artists, and marketed as \"fine art.\u201d \nThis poster would be the first example of Bradley\u2019s poster design in the museum\u2019s graphic design collection. The museum currently holds many examples of his cover designs from Collier\u2019s Weekly (for which Bradley served as art editor from 1907\u201310), Scribner\u2019s Magazine, and Harper\u2019s. This poster also complements other objects in the museum\u2019s collection that demonstrate the influence of the Arts and Crafts aesthetic, including Rookwood Pottery, wallcoverings by Morris & Co. (notably, the Pimpernel and Persian designs), and woven textiles by Morris & Co. (Tulip and Rose from 1876 being a particularly fine example). Three of Beardsley\u2019s art illustrations are also held by the museum at the time of this proposed acquisition.\nMay 14, 2003",
    "gallery_text": "The Blue Lady was American graphic designer William Henry Bradley\u2019s second poster for The Chap-Book, America\u2019s first \u201clittle magazine.\u201d First published by Harvard students Herbert Stuart Stone and Hannibal Ingalls Kimball, Jr. in 1894, The Chap-Book featured poetry, prose, and art from the up-and-coming members of the artistic and literary community. Following a practice common in Europe, posters of the magazine\u2019s cover were produced, serving as both advertisements and as collector\u2019s items. In addition to hanging in shop windows and on billboards, these posters were found in the homes of poster collectors in America and abroad. The Blue Lady is a stunning example of the early introduction of the Art Nouveau aesthetic to American graphic design. But the poster also reflects a nuanced influence of the Japanese woodblock prints from the middle of the 19th century, which had become widely circulated among collectors not only in Europe, but also in cities such as New York and Chicago.",
    "label_text": "Bradley used two contrasting inks\u2014a sumptuous blue and a vibrant vermilion\u2014to create this poster. He generated a third color by overprinting them, resulting in the rich, dark purple of the trees and the woman\u2019s coat. The thicket of vermilion-edged trees is a carefully planned by-product of the overprinting.",
