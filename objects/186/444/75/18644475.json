    "description": "One half of the design, in color, comprises the right-hand page, while the other half, in black and white, comprises the left of this photo print shop advertisement. The head shot of the artist, Andy Warhol, occupying the center from top to bottom, is divided vertically in the center, so that one half of his face appears on each page. His body, depicted upwards from just below shoulder level, extends at the shoulders about two-thirds of the way across each page. His straight, white blond hair, cut unevenly, brushes the tops of his ears, and falls to the side in bangs. He stares at the viewer through colorless, plastic rimmed glasses;  his slightly parted lips are curved downward. He wears a white shirt with frayed collar; a yellow, red and black rep tie; and a black jacket. On the gray (left) and red (right) backgrounds, nine different Stat Store services, four on the left and five on the right, are listed, with their prices, within narrow bands formed by thin black lines. Identical images of a curved black page, imprinted The Stat Store in white capitals, are located in the bottom outside corners, accompanied by five lines of store information.",
