    "description":"The object, folded in eighths for mailing, comprises  two rows of four rectangles each when fully opened. When removed from its envelope, and remaining closed, only one rectangle, #4 in row 2 of the verso, is visible.\n\nRecto: The information in this invitation to a benefit performance of the film, Something Wild, is imprinted in a continuing narrative in black and red on a white ground, in the following order: Row 1, #1: five lines;  row 2, #2, five lines; row 1, #3, seven lines. The alternate four rectangles consist of a scratch pattern of thick black lines. The second word of the film title, wild, is imprinted in bold red letters, superimposed unevenly on all eight rectangles.\n\nVerso: When opened, row 2 becomes row 1, and the #4 rectangle is now #1, in an upside-down position.  When right side up, it shows a sketched illustration of a guest check against a black scratch pattern. Row 1, #2, consisting of a pair of handcuffs and #4, of a dagger, also on the scratch pattern ground, refer to the film's story. In row 1, #3, the word some, and in row 2, #4, thing, both in black capitals on a white ground, together form the first word of the film title. A sketch of a liquor bottle in row 2, #2, on a white ground, is labelled Seagram's, the benefit's major sponsor. The remaining item, in row 2, #3, is a sketch of a white name tag, on a scratch pattern ground, labelled hello\/ my name is\/ Dottie, in black;  row 2, #1, shows only a scratch pattern.",
