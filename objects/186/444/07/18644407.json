    "description": "The page is divided into four quarters, with black backgrounds in the upper left and lower right and white in the upper right and lower left.  The featured objects are in tones of gray. Upper left: a man's tie, diagonally place and centered, in an abstract pattern of curves, swirls and thin lines suggesting a stringed instrument. Upper right: a banded stack of $100 bills, also diagonally placed and centered. Lower left:  a bed pillow, centered, and crushed as if someone has just been lying on it. Lower right: an emergency vehicle, centered, with its front end facing left. In white italicized type, New Republic appears just below the top of the upper left quarter and New York just below the center in the bottom right quarter. One line of type in small capitals is centered just above the bottom edge of the page: clothiers for men and women, followed by the street address and telephone number.",
