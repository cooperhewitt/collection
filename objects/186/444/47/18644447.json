    "description":"Recto: In the upper right-hand quadrant, the Memphis (condominiums) logo, in red, is followed underneath by the word downtown; underneath that are four lines, consisting of the Memphis (condominiums) business office address and telephone number at the downtown location. In the lower right-hand quadrant,  a hole, a little larger than a pinprick, is punched.\n\nVerso: A pink and black grid of the Manhattan area that includes the downtown Memphis (condominium) dominates the space, ending on the left, in a gray space, at the West Side Highway. The incised hole now appears in the lower left quadrant, marking the location of the downtown condominium.",
