    "description": "Recto: There is a pink and black Manhattan street grid, stretching from Eleventh Street at the lower edge to Fifty-Seventh Street at the upper, and from Tenth Avenue at the left edge to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, almost to the center. \n\nVerso: The grid design continues from the recto, this time on the right, on both the flap and body of the envelope . A red square on the flap marks the uptown condominium location. Beneath the flap, the grid is cut off on the diagonal on the right, forming a white space from the diagonal edge to the right edge. The Memphis (condominiums) logo is imprinted in that space, with the word uptown just above it and the two line address beneath, both in black.",
