    "description": "A full-page photographic frontal image of a monkey, brown-tinged black with white highlights, is overlaid by apricot-colored capital letters A-Z, arranged in six evenly spaced rows. The monkey seems to smile; his arms are bent at the elbows; and with his left hand, he is picking off the petals of a long-stemmed flower, which he is holding in his right. On the upper part of the page, against the left edge, is a three-part identification: Adweek, in upside-down capitals on a pale green diagonal band in the upper left-hand corner abuts the top edge of Portfolio, imprinted in white capitals on a green-gray vertical band along the left edge, while Marketing and Promotion Resources, in white capitals on a lavender vertical, narrow band, diagonally abuts the rignt edge of the Portfolio band.",
