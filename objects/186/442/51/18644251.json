A full length pocket, from mid-page to the right edge, is incised in an allover pattern of helter-skelter rectangles. With the folder closed, the incised format is designed to reveal the [now missing] contrasting inserts. \nInside: Pockets, incised with varying geometric shapes, are positioned on the diagonal in both the left and right halves. The reverse view of Star is visible on the upper right of the left half. An additional scallop-edge pocket, almost full-length and width, is positioned behind the diagonal pocket in the right half.",
