    "description": "The present object is one in a series of The Sun, a humorous tabloid newspaper published in Florida and marketed to college students on spring break in the Fort Lauderdale-Daytona Beach area. The publication's motto, Take This News and Love it, imprinted on page one underneath the edition title, establishes the satirical thrust of the paper. The design format comprises photographs of the vacationing population, along with captions and text mocking both the subjects and their activities; beach-themed cartoons, such as Digger and Lunk Beach Bozos; articles about entertainers popular among the targeted readers; Dear Abby, a nationally syndicated advice column by Abigail Van Buren; and Camel cigarette advertisements.\n\nIn this issue, a front page above-the-waist photograph of a smiling, long-haired young woman is captioned: Going bald? Bianca Baker of Los Angeles was slick as a cue ball till she\/ started using Taylor's Malted Fish Emulsion for her conditioner. No longer\/ blinding her chums on the beach, Bianca is now running for President.",
