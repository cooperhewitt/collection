    "description": "The present object is one in a series of The Sun, a humorous tabloid newspaper published in Florida and marketed to college students on spring break in the Fort Lauderdale-Daytona Beach area. The publication's motto, Take This News and Love it, imprinted on page one underneath the edition title, establishes the satirical thrust of the paper. The design format comprises photographs of the vacationing population, along with captions and text mocking both the subjects and their activities; beach-themed cartoons, such as Digger & Lunk Beach Bozos; articles about entertainers popular among the targeted readers; Dear Abby, a nationally syndicated advice column by Abigail Van Buren; and Camel cigarette advertisements.\n\nThe front page above-the-waist photograph features two smiling young women. Their heads are touching, and the upraised outer arm of the one on the left is bent around the neck of the other. The caption reads: Tag-team wrestlers from Kansas Kendra McMullen and Dorothy Wilson. Squeeze Till it Hurts.",
