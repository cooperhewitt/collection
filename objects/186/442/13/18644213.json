    "description":"The design immediately signals parody in the magazine's cover title: the W of week in Newsweek, which is imprinted across the top in bold, gold-colored type, is askew. What might have been a legitimate concern of the real magazine, Newsweek, Inc., is satirized in the feature announced on the cover, Nuclear Arms and Terrific Legs, imprinted in bold white type, accompanied by a color photograph of three young women making silly faces, their hands in see-hear-and-speak-no evil poses.  A flaming ball, simulating an atomic explosion, is in the background. The Atomic Threat to America's Cover Girls is imprinted across, just above the bottom edge. \n\nThe fifty-four page publication consists of articles and color or black and white photographs or illustrations satirizing the actual magazine's content and format, interspersed with legitimate advertisements.",
