    "gallery_text": "\u201cZed\u201d (Czech for wall) was designed for the \u201cZeitwande\u201d collection. The wallpaper, a white relief vinyl with the texture of rough plaster, was dotted with blown glass beads available in a variety of colors. Small indentations on the surface of the vinyl indicated where the beads were to be glued after installation; a tube of super glue was included with each purchase. While appliqu\u00e9s have been used on wallpapers back to at least the 1850s, this is the first application of blown glass beads on a wallcovering. The beads not only produce greater surface relief and color contrast, but they also create dramatic shadows that change with the light source.\n\u0160ipek was introduced to glass arts at a young age by his stepfather, an established Czech glass artisan. \u0160ipek became known for his use of contrasting materials which were frequently used in unexpected combinations. He studied furniture design, architecture, and philosophy at schools in Prague and Germany and received a Doctorate in Architecture from the Technical University of Delft in 1979. \u0160ipek opened his own architecture and design studio in Amsterdam in 1983.",
