    "description": "The object presents as if it were a book. On both front and back covers, the title, Color+Color Formica Corporation, is imprinted in a sans-serif type, black on a white background, the words arranged in a circular pattern, centered; the font size gradually decreases from Color+Color to Corporation. Designed by M&Co, New York appears on the back cover, just above the bottom edge. The cover design is repeated on the inside front cover, left. On the inside cover, right, in a corresponding position to and identical size and shape of the design on the left, are nineteen lines of type, headed Color+Color, comprising a guide to the color chip samples within. These are arranged in rows of three on six interior panels, each with an additional flap unfolding downward. With the object in open position, the right and left-most flaps, folded toward the center, display half-width columns of copy. A business card, encased in clear plastic, is included on the bottom right.",
