    "description": "As a working copy, this object shows the development of the Chiat\/Day self-promotion project, SONY Space. The case is covered by one page of text, recto and verso. A third page of text is incised to hold a booklet, a videocassette (not included) and case, and an audiocassette (not included), case, and case liner. The black and white booklet cover, with a grey border, is composed of a nighttime street scene with electrified signs; the top right-hand corner is turned down and is imprinted Advertising and Nothing But, with a crowd of people behind. SPACE is imprinted in large type across the upper part; SONY is imprinted immediately below on the left, once horizontally and twice vertically, surrounding a white rectangular space. There are two additional blanks in white below the Sony area and two smaller white blanks on the lower right. The videocassette case reproduces a photograph of the upper part of a face, showing eyes and brows. Chiat Day Mojo's Greates Hits-A tape that will forever prove that commercials are better than T.V. shows is imprinted across the top. The audiocassette case liner reproduces a partial profile view of a man's face,, showing an ear and hair. Radio is imprinted on the left and What it would sound like if Chiat Day Mojo was the world's only agency on the right.",
