    "description":"Recto: Pat Metheny Group in capital letters and Still life (talking) are imprinted on a narrow off-white horizontal band at the top. In the upper third, on the left, is a black and white image of a woman in a bathing suit and cap and on the right, a color image composed of two segments, a partial view of the letters S and A in pink on a rough beige surface and a close-up of yellow leaves, edged in green, of a tropical plant, with sunlight peeking through. The lower two-thirds consist of a blurred image of a boy or young woman in profile, with a braid of black hair cascading over the shoulder, wearing a beige hat and a pinkish-orage shirt. On the left, starting under the title band, is a blue vertical strip in of sky and ocean.\nVerso: Color images of band members identified by their initials: just in from the left, top, P.M. and guitar; directly below, L.M. and keyboards; just in from the left, bottom, P.W. and S.R., and on the right, lower part, A.M.; directly underneath, D.B. and M.L. with microphones. Directly underneath L.M., on a yellow background, the names and functions of the band personnel; at bottom, left, the titles of the songs and names of thefeatured vocalists. At bottom, center, on a purple background, musical production details and right, design production details. Remaining segments consist of one image of urban buildings at center top and another larger image, directly beneath, of desert growth, mountains and sky; two images of lined notepaper, annotated; and a checkered patterned housefront with a curtained window against a blue sky.",
