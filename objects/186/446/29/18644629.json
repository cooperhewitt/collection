    "description":"A view of tourists facing the geyser, Old Faithful, Yellowstone National Park, spans the back and front covers. Against a background of an evergreen forest, a casually dressed crowd stands on a stretch of lawn or sits on benches beyond. The site is identified on the upper left of the back cover. To read the catalog title, M&Co Labs, imprinted on the geyser in the center of the front cover, one turns the object to a horizontal position. \n\nThe thirty page catalog features the M&Co Labs watches collection, divided into four sections, labeled black, gold, silver and pocket, each introduced on a solid color page. The watches are photographed one to a page, centered on the page and attached to their wristbands, accompanied by the product name imprinted in black on a white band at the bottom of the page. Several pages of explanatory text are interspersed. Just before the last section, a photograph of Stonehenge, labeled Not for Sale on the white band, is inserted.",
