    "justification": "The acquisition of this contemporary copy, after a lost Salviati original, would fill a gap in our collection of Italian Renaissance decorative arts material. This drawing will be featured in the exhibition prepared by Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s curators in conjunction with students of the Cooper Hewitt\/Parsons Masters Program in the History of Decorative Arts, Disegno: Italian Renaissance Designs for the Decorative Arts (February 11\u2013May 18, 1997). The exhibition, which will be seen by Renaissance decorative arts and drawings scholars and the general public, along with its related catalog, will provide a unique opportunity to study the drawing in a larger context in order to reach new conclusions about its attribution and its relationship to similar designs that appear to come from the same studio.",
