These horrors\/  although shroudded in secrecy throughout his lifetime, and by\/ his principal biographers, are confirmed in a series of letters\/ and diary entries dound, long after his death, under a floor\/ board in his study. After marrying effie Gray, who was\/ born in the room in which Ruskin's grandfather had\/ committed suicide, he declared her \"unfit for con-\/ sumation\", adding that he would reconsider when\/ she reached the age of twenty-five (he was\/ twenty-eight and she was nineteen), six\/ years later, on her twenty-fifth birthday,\/ Rushkin had still not reckoned with his\/ legendary disdain for pubic hair, and told\/ her that she was still unfit, citing religious reasons for his abstention.  Quite\/ shortly after, the marriage was annulled and Effie was remarried to the Pre-\/ Raphaelite painter, John Millais.\"",
