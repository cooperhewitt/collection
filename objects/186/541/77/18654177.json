    "gallery_text": "In April of 1984, when postmodernism was becoming an established movement in popular discourse, the Architecture League of New York organized two lectures debating the future of architecture. The two-part series  delivered by Arthur Drexler, the director of the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art at the time, disagreed with the widely held sentiment that modernism was dead. He instead saw it as a period \u201cthat ...merit[ed] investigation and analysis.\u201d  This poster designed by Michael Bierut and Massimo Vignelli announced the talks \u2014\u201cThe Devaluation of Architecture\u201d and \u201cArchitecture in the Millenium\u201d were the official titles\u2014 and uses typography to visualize the breakdown of a traditional, rational modernism.  Solid white bars create the letters and progressively become thinner, suggesting what the title of the piece itself alludes to: unfinished modern. Bierut spent the first decade of his career working for the late and legendary designer Massimo Vingnelli  before becoming a partner at the prominent graphic design studio Pentagram, a position he continues to hold today.",
