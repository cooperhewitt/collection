In the black section, in white, words are situated at a 90-degree angle, that from a distance, looks like a cityscape with skyscrapers. This reads: DESIGNING \/ NEW \/ YORK: \/ PARADIGM \/ AND PARADOX. \/ A COLLOQUIUM \/ TO \/ EXPLORE \/ THE \/ REVITALIZATION \/ OF \/ NEW \/ YORK \/ THROUGH \/ DESIGN. OCTOBER 3, \/ 1991.

    "gallery_text": "New York-based graphic designer Michael Bierut created this poster for the Designing New York Committee\u2019s Save Our City event in 1991, while a new partner at Pentagram (he joined the firm\u2019s New York office the year before). The black and white poster promotes and commemorates a symposium on how design might improve residents\u2019 experience of living in the city.  This high-contrast piece shows Bierut\u2019s expertise in manipulating type. The top half of the poster is black and phrases in white block capitals are turned on their side to evoke Manhattan\u2019s skyscrapers seen from a distance. \u201cSave Our City\u201d is printed in black type of varying sizes with only the bottom portion of the word \u201csave\u201d is seen; it blends with the swath of black from above, conjuring a sinking feeling, or of being consumed by the environment. Bierut is a master of utilizing optical tricks to convey his concepts graphically. He designs for his audience,  and is careful to consider the most direct way of relating information to those who will receive it.",
