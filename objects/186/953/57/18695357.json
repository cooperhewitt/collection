    "description": "Imprinted in gray ink, striped IBM logo, vertically (facing in). In font resembling children's playing blocks, upper left quadrant: Quality. Imprinted in font similar to Book Antiqua, three text blocks, lower half of page, describing Paul Rand's ideas of quality: his definition of the word, what it isn't, and what it is concerned with. First text block: The concept of quality is difficult to define, for it is not\/ merely seen, but somehow intuited in the presence of the work in\/ which it is embodied. Quality has little to do with popular\/ notions of beauty, taste, or style; and nothing to do with status,\/ respectability, or luxury. It is revealed, rather, in an atmosphere\/ of receptivity, propriety, and restraint.; second text block: Quality is concerned with the weighing of relationships; the\/ discovery of analogies and contrasts; with proportion and harmony;\/ the juxtaposition of formal and functional elements-with\/ their transformation and enrichment.; third text block: Quality is concerned with truth, not deception; with ideas, not\/ techniques; with the enduring, not the ephemeral; with precision,\/ not fussiness; with simplicity, not vacuity; with subtlety, not\/ blatancy; with sensitivity, not sentimentality.",
