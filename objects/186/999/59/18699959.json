    "justification": "Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo (1871\u20131949) began his career as a painter, etcher and sculptor, but early on developed an interest in all manner of design and decorative arts, creating textiles, fashions, lamps, furniture and interiors, as well as designs for the stage. Believing that the artist should control every detail of production, Fortuny also invented and patented his own processes and machinery, in areas as varied as photography, lighting design, and textile printing. Born in Madrid and raised in Paris, he eventually made Venice his home and established his business there. The textile mill has been in almost continuous operation since it began with the introduction of the Delphos dress in 1907 (The factory was closed briefly after Fortuny died in 1949). \nWhile Fortuny\u2019s textile designs draw heavily on the woven silks of Renaissance Italy, he also traveled extensively and drew inspiration from Persian silks, Coptic Egyptian ornament, and classical Greek garment styles. Emulating the patterns, rich colors, and metallic sheen of these woven silks, Fortuny used silkscreen technology and his own patented dyeing and printing process, which involved natural dyes, discharge or bleaching agents, and metallic inks.&amp;nbsp; \n\nFiore, a dyed and printed cotton, was designed by Fortuny in the 1920s,and more than likely woven on a narrow loom in his home. The Fortuny Factory, on the Guidecca in Venice, opened in 1922, and half-width fabrics such as this were discontinued completely in the mid-1920s. This piece was probably made by Fortuny himself in the late teens or early twenties. The pattern itself is based on a Persian silk pattern and continues to be made today, but not in this color combination. The ground fabric has a marbled effect in shades of purple and pink, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, and is then overprinted with silver ink in a pattern of stylized flowers and vines.",
