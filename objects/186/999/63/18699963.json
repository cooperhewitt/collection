    "justification":"Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo (1871\u20131949) began his career as a painter, etcher and sculptor, but early on developed an interest in all manner of design and decorative arts, creating textiles, fashions, lamps, furniture and interiors, as well as designs for the stage. Believing that the artist should control every detail of production, Fortuny also invented and patented his own processes and machinery, in areas as varied as photography, lighting design, and textile printing. Born in Madrid and raised in Paris, he eventually made Venice his home and established his business there. The textile mill has been in almost continuous operation since it began with the introduction of the Delphos dress in 1907 (The factory was closed briefly after Fortuny died in 1949). \nWhile Fortuny\u2019s textile designs draw heavily on the woven silks of Renaissance Italy, he also traveled extensively and drew inspiration from Persian silks, Coptic Egyptian ornament, and classical Greek garment styles. Emulating the patterns, rich colors, and metallic sheen of these woven silks, Fortuny used silkscreen technology and his own patented dyeing and printing process, which involved natural dyes, discharge or bleaching agents, and metallic inks.&amp;nbsp; \nThis example of de Medicis was designed by Fortuny and manufactured in his factory sometime during the 1930s and 40s. This textile is more difficult to date because the Fortuny Factory continues to use the same machines, dye recipes, techniques, and long-staple Egyptian cotton foundation now as then. This pattern was first printed in the 1930s and continues to be produced today in the same colorways. The dyed cotton and printed textile boasts a ground fabric has a marbled effect in shades of pink and red, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, and then overprinted with silver metallic ink in an arabesque pattern.",
