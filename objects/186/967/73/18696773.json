    "description": "Surface divided roughly into thirds.  Upper and lower third are book end images of each other consisting of plant with three flowers growing from central stem and with long, slim, sharply-pointed leaves on branches. On either side of central images, five rows of black and white diamond pattern. In central third of field, zig-zag pattern in black and white surrounding an empty bow-shaped field inside of which appears \"Spitzen der Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte.\" Upper and lower edges of image are \"pinked\" as in textile.",
    "justification": "Dagobert Peche was described by Josef Hoffmann as the \u201cgreatest decorative genius\u201d that Austria had produced since the baroque period. When Peche joined the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte in 1915 and succeeded Hoffmann as director, his highly idiosyncratic, decorative style changed the prevailing aesthetic that had previously dominated Werkst\u00e4tte production. Instead of the severe grids and simple geometric forms used by Hoffmann and Koloman Moser, Peche introduced stylized plant forms, animals, and garlands of fruit that optimistically celebrated the bounty of life. After his release from military service in World War I, Peche and his family moved to Zurich to establish a branch of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte. Because Switzerland was not subject to wartime restrictions on metals, Peche was able to open a silver and metal workshop. Peche also initiated the production of lace, which was an ideal medium to reproduce his airy and fanciful drawings. Lacemaking also capitalized on the available female workforce during wartime.\nIn Zurich, between 1917 and 1919, Peche produced numerous designs for bobbin lace insets and borders, drawn thread work in tulle, and tulle embroidery that were produced in Bohemia or Vienna by women working at home. This lacework was sold at the Werkst\u00e4tte\u2019s Swiss branch and, beginning in 1918, at its fabric shop in Vienna at 32 K\u00e4rntnerstrasse. When Peche was called back to Vienna in 1919, he created a special salesroom on the third floor of the shop for lace, ribbons, and various articles made from Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte fabrics. \nPeche\u2019s striking and relatively rare poster, Spitzen der Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte (Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte Lacework), which promotes the workshops\u2019 lace production, is dated around the time of Peche\u2019s return to Vienna. His use of small patterns of black and white mimics the openwork of lace, especially the fanciful tree or plant with its slender, sharply pointed leaves. Similar plant forms appear in Peche\u2019s wallpaper design Der Spitz (1990-127-7) in the museum\u2019s collection of wallcoverings in which various tree and plant motifs, created mainly for tulle work, are randomly strewn about to create a graphic pattern. The poster directly relates to other objects by Peche in the museum\u2019s collection, including two examples of  lace (1999-36-1,2) and a silver vase (1962-227-2). \nNovember 26, 2002",
