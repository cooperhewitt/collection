    "description": "Orange, green, and yellow striped hat with a large cluster of finger-like projections or burls on each side. Each projection is also striped and the shape is reinforced with wood. A small tassel hangs from the center back.",
    "justification": "Traditional African hats are highly expressive of the diversity of the continent. Hats can serve a religious or ceremonial function or indicate the occupation or hierarchy of the wearer in civic or social societies. It can also indicate the marital status of the man or woman. \nIn Cameroon, hats are one of the oldest and most important parts of the national dress. There are several types of hats worn in the Cameroon Grasslands, and this particular type is an ashetu, or a prestige hat. This sort of hat is generally reserved for elite males as well as a very limited number of elite women. Fitting snuggly on the head, the hat supports the striped projections or burls that are on both sides. The whole crown of the hat may be covered with burls or, as in this example, it may be divided on the left and right sides by vertical lines of color. The burls reflect the tufted hairstyle worn by high-ranking men in Cameroon culture. \n   \nThe museum has a small collection of African hats primarily made out of raffia with a basket-weave technique. This Cameroon hat, however, represents a very different technique: crocheted wool with wood-reinforced burls. Not only is it stylistically different, but it is also geographically distinctive from other, similar hats in the collection, most of which originate from Zaire (known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo). This proposed acquisition also adds to the museum\u2019s larger collection of men\u2019s and women\u2019s hats spanning several centuries and continents that most often relates to the technique of embroidery.",
    "gallery_text": "The Cameroon grasslands area is made up of many chiefdoms, each with its own social and political hierarchy which typically includes the king or Fon, title-holders, and commoners. Power and prestige are displayed through elements of dress, especially hats. \nThe Ashetu hat is worn by the Fon on ceremonial occasions. Fitting snugly on the head, the crocheted cap supports projections or burls on both sides, each made rigid by a small splint of wood. The burls are commonly thought of as physical manifestations of one\u2019s inner head, considered the center of intelligence and spirituality. They also reflect the tufted hairstyles once worn by high-ranking men. Earlier pieces tend to be more in the natural tones of raffia; this example, using the pan-African colors of green, gold and orange, may have been made after Cameroon achieved its independence from France in 1960.",
