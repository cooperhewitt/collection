    "gallery_text": "Following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France (1685) Daniel Marot fled to Holland, where he worked for William of Orange and his court. Marot produced extravagant designs for everything from beds, to curtains and mirrors. In his designs for gardens, Marot balanced a passion for ornament and order, as illustrated here with a semi-enclosed garden surrounded by a berceau or tunnel arcade. The grid-like structure of the parterres \u2013 delineated by straight paths and a square garden tunnel \u2013 owes much to tradition, reminiscent of French and Dutch Renaissance gardens, such as those depicted by Androuet du Cerceau in \u201cThe most Excellent Buildings of France\u201d (1576-79). In contrast, Marot\u2019s proposition for a swerving interior tunnel arcade is highly original, inspired by ornamental motifs and probably also by the gardens at Het Loo Palace. Adding innovation to a traditional scheme, Marot successfully combines old and new in a design already heralding the baroque creations of the 18th century.",
