    "gallery_text": "In a relatively short period of time, Alvin Lustig, who died at the young age of forty, designed some of the most formidable book covers in American twentieth-century design. Among these are over eighty  covers Lustig designed for New Directions from 1941 to 1955, including this cover of Selected Poems by Kenneth Patchen.  The idea that a jacket had to directly reference its content no longer necessarily applied; book covers mixing symbols, text and color, appealed directly to potential buyers. Booksellers began paying attention to the visual appearance of books in the 1940s and 1950s, and created visual displays in their store windows and shop floors for merchandise that was now designed to be off of the shelves and be seen.",
    "label_text": "Functioning like a small poster, a book cover must quickly capture a viewer\u2019s attention and provoke curiosity about the content within, contributing an enduring element to the reader\u2019s experience. The covers designed by Alvin Lustig in the 1940s and 1950s employ abstracted iconography and simple typography and lettering to create emotionally compelling representations of a book\u2019s themes. Lustig, who died at 40, is remembered as one of America\u2019s greatest modern designers.",
