Printed in black ink, back cover: in art\/The A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts\/by JACQUES MARITAIN\/In this volume Jacques Maritain proposes to make\/both the distinction and the indissoluble rela-\/tionship between art and poetry. He insists on the\/part played by the intellect in both art and poetry,\/and especially on the fact that poetry has its source\/in the intuitve activity of the internet.\/In the process of illuminating his argument, Pro-\/fessor Maritain discusses the poetry of Eliot and\/Thomas, the painting of Roualt and Picasso, the\/music of Bach and Mozart, the philosophy of Plato,\/Aristotle, and St. Thomas Aquainus.\/\"(Jacques Maritain) is the most powerful force in\/contemporary French philosophy.\" TS ELIOT\/All Meridian Books are Smyth-Sewn for Durability.",
