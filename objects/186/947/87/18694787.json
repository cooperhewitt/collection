Printed in black ink, back cover: New Directions\/An anthology of\/new directions in prose and poetry\/International issue\/This volume is the fifteenth in a series of anthologies\/which began to appear in 1936. Since that first issue,\/which presented work by Pound and Stein, Cummings\/and Cocteau, New Directions has grown on the theory\/that literature \u2013 and, in fact, culture itself \u2013 goes dead\/when there is no experiment. Writers of other lands,\/and especially those of Asia, are represented in New\/Directions 15 in the hope that there can be estab-\/lished and maintained through arts and letters a com-\/mon meeting ground for intercultural understanding,\/the \u201cworld literature\u201d of which Goethe dreamed.\/\u201cNew Directions lives up to its intention, that of\/presenting fresh, explorative, and unstereotyped\/writing.\u201d THE NEW YORK TIMES\/\u201cThe literary life of this country owes a great deal\/to James Laughlin and his New Directions\u2026 He\/has deliberately looked not for the commercially suc-\/cessful but for the imaginatively original.\u201d\/THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE\/All Meridian Books are Smyth-Sewn for Durability.",
