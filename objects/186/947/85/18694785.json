Readers of poetry are thus enabled\/for the first time, to see how this relatively\/young poet has developed over a fifteen-year\/period.\/\"At thirty-six Miss Rukeyser comes before\/us the vetran of an unremitting effort to\/reconcile her scientific and political assump-\/tions with those of the romantic personalism\/and the world-oppressed sensibility\/which are\/perhaps our chief modern conventions. It has\/been a difficult effort, too often losing itself\/in an unhappy, violent confession of dilemma\/or wishfully asserting an incompletely earned\/sense of triumph. But she has been, probably,\/the most persistent of those poets who have\/tried, in the Thirties especially, with so much\/passion to force through this reconciliation.\/(Among those whose work seemed to affect\/her most when she began writing were the\/'Auden-Group' in England and Hart Crane\/(Continued on back flap)\/$1.50.",
