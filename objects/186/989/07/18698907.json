    "description":"Fine, highly compactible dark red fishing net.",
    "justification":"This fine, dark red encircling fishing net, designed in 1996 by Toray Industries (manufactured in 2003), requires very specialized physical characteristics for its ultimate performance as a fishing net. It must be strong enough for fishermen to haul in hundreds of pounds of fish while light enough for easy handling and storage. Made of Tetoron polyester, the net has the ability to expand from 1 \u00bd&quot; to 132&quot; and weighs only a few pounds.&amp;nbsp; It is a machine-made net consisting of pairs of twisted threads that connect to form the net by crossing through each other. The basic movements of the threads are the same used to make a bobbin lace net, or bobbinet,&amp;nbsp;a technique developed in the late 19th century. The technique is modernized here with polyester yarn and in the final stage, the textile undergoes a heat treatment to eliminate distortions which creates a flattened surface. Additionally, since it is essentially a knotless net it prevents bruising of the fish, which is important to cultures like that of Japan which relies on presentation, whether in food, tea or flowers, to assure a harmonious ensemble.",
