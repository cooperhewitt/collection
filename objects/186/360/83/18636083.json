The roof is surmounted by a red flagpole, from which a blue, white and red banner hangs.  The roof is supported by two thin columns with red stripes.  The lower wall of the pavilion is divided into several bands of decoration.  The uppermost portion is made up of two rows of blue scrolling wave decorations with a solid green band between.  Below is a large horizontal plaque with green and red swag decorations.  Below this is a thin band of terra cotta colored wave designs, which rests on top of a series of similarly colored vertical rectangles.  The whole structure rests on a peach and gray marble base.",
