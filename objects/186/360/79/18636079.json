    "description": "Design for the low side wall of a music pavilion, which supports three tall light posts. The two matching end light posts are decorated with blue and white stripes and gold accents.  The top of each post terminates in a large white globe lantern, with three smaller globe lanterns below, two colored orange and the third red.  The shorter central lamp post is articulated with red and white stripes and is surmounted by a gold eagle, upon which rests a white globe lantern.  Two urn-shaped flowerpots are placed between the light posts and rest on the pavilion wall below.  The low side wall of the pavilion is divided into several rectangular ornamental compartments, which are decorated in a variety of patterns and colors.  A large portion of the upper half of the wall is decorated with two-toned abstract, geometric patterning and the lower wall is decorated with a series of vertically-oriented, rectangular sections of pink marble, which rests on a horizontal gray marble base.",
