    "description":"Perspective view of a narrow corridor, with a doorway at the far end. In the foreground, the wall leading to the area has a pagoda-like canopy over the entrance. On either side of the door is a pair of columns with trellis-work panels between them. Trellis-work panels cover the walls of the corridor and doors.  The very elaborate and highly worked designs appear both on the walls and in the carpet. The abstract treatment of the dragon slithering down the edge of the canopy creates an abstract scrolling pattern seen in other designs. Designed for glass passage.\n\nOriginal album associated with this collection still exists.  See 1948-40-1 accessory",
