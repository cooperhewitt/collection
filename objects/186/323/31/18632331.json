    "description": "Scene inside a liquor shop.  A boy, center middleground, stands on a chair in front of shelves holding jars of fruits in plum liquor.  He has just dropped some jars on the floor and is about to jump off the chair when he sees two people observing the mishap through a barred windo, rear left.  Another child and a shop worker, in the lower right corner, turn turn around towards the boy to observe the unfortunate event.  \n\n1989-13-24-b   This is the backing sheet to which 1989-13-24-a was affixed.   The dimensions of sheet 16.8 x 22.2 cm (6 9\/16 x 8 11\/16 in.).  Sheet inscribed in graphite, upper center:  Les tourtes de dessert et les tartes [crossed out in graphite]; at upper right:  Les flans (poire etc.; in pen and brown ink, upper right:  N\u00b0 12; inscribed in graphite, lower left verso:  17 Janvier\/1820 [January 17, 1820]  The fact that a scene called Fruits in Plum Liquor was attached to a sheet with two different subjects inscribed on it might suggest that the genre scenes were so general as to be interchangeable.  Condition:  water staining ? along left edge; stains along right edge; upper left and right corners bent; tape and glue residue center.",
