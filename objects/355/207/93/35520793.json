    "description": "Design for a circular table: plan, elevation, and detail. Plan of table shows veined pattern; detail of elevation where table top meets support; elevation shows three legs in wishbone-like design that join at the top. Left margin, column of printed text in light gray. Inscriptions in graphite throughout.",
    "justification": "This monumental and impressive piece can be admired not only for its meticulous engineering detail, but also as for its beauty, which recalls a transparent view of the human body.\nThis study for the Leaf Table, a presentation drawing by Dutch designer Joris Laarman, falls into the category of nature-based design (biotechnology), a popular area of exploration for 21st-century designers and computer engineers. Like Laarman\u2019s celebrated Bone Chair (2007), the Leaf Table design is based on a computer algorithm that mimics the way bones grow in nature, adding or diminishing material depending on where strength is needed. The drawing was made for a 2010 exhibition at the Friedman Benda Gallery in New York City to explain in detail to the dealer, as well as to viewers, what the table would look like pre-construction, and what materials would be used in its final fabrication. (The fabricated object is in the collection of Atlanta\u2019s High Museum of Art.) \nDocumentation of the 3-D prototyping process marks a relatively new area of collecting for the museum. This presentation drawing would be the second such design drawing to enter the museum\u2019s collection, joining a drawing by Erwan and Ronan Bouroullec for the Vegetal Chair, which was produced by Vitra using prototyping equipment as part of the design process. This proposed gift explores a more complicated design fabricated by similar technology. ",
