    "gallery_text": "PillCam capsule endoscopy was created to directly observe the gastrointestinal (GI) system while maintaining patient comfort. Traditionally, physicians examine the GI tract using radiological images; exploratory surgery; \"push\" endoscopy; transnasal scope insertion; colonoscopy; or barium enema. With capsule endoscopy, patients swallow a small digital video camera with LEDs that illuminate surroundings. A transmitter then exports pictures of the small intestines\u2014approximately 50,000 during its route\u2014to a wireless data recorder worn on the waist. The PillCam can image places, such as parts of the intestines, that other techniques have difficulty reaching and can identify conditions like bleeding, tumors, vascular lesions and diagnose malabsorption disorders. Dr. Gavriel Iddan, a former missile designer in the Israeli Ministry of Defense, invented PillCam when, after undergoing a colonoscopy, he imagined a tiny camera traveling through the intestine. The PillCam was born after he devised a way to miniaturize imaging system technology.",
    "label_text": "Imagined by the inventor in the 1990s as a tiny vessel with a camera traveling through the intestines, the PillCam\u00ae now replaces more invasive surgical procedures. The patient swallows the single-use \u201cpill\u201d and light-emitting diodes illuminate the intestinal walls, transmitting images to a wireless data recorder. The data are downloaded to a computer and analyzed by a physician.",
