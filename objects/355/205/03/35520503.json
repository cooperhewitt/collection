    "gallery_text": "Made of local iron, this throwing knife was fashioned by professional blacksmiths. Smiths were not only masters of the technical skills required to forge and shape iron, but they were steeped in the ritual aspects of their work. A smith\u2019s tools included an anvil on which to pound out the iron, several types of hammers and chisel-like tools, and materials and instruments to sharpen the blades and prepare the surface of the knife. While engineered to be thrown underhand horizontally from the hip, this multibladed knife had other practical uses as well: as a dagger, an axe and as a blade to cut a path through brush. Because iron was such a valuable material, these knives were prestige items and could be used as currency. This is one of sixty knives collected by Herbert Ward in the Congo Free State, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, between 1884 and 1889.",
    "label_text": "These multibladed knives, made by professional blacksmiths, served for warfare and hunting, and as axes and currency. To be aerodynamic, a knife required a particular height\u2013width ratio and standardized weight, and the handle was covered with braided fiber to maintain the tool\u2019s balance. Knives were thrown either underhand horizontally from the hip or vertically over the shoulder.",
