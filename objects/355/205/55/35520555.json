    "gallery_text": "Tools crafted and used by our human ancestors appear in the prehistoric record dating back at least 2.6 million years; the earliest tools were made of stone. This simply altered stone, called a \"chopper\", from the famed archeological site Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, is around 1.85 million years old. The discovery of such artifacts at Olduvai Gorge gave the name to the world\u2019s oldest Stone Age technology, the Oldowan. Choppers were made using a hammerstone to knap, that is, repeatedly striking off sharp, useful flakes along an edge. The stone is a volcanic rock called nephelinite, from a lava flow south of Olduvai. This basic technology, which produced tools for cutting, pounding, and crushing, enabled humans to obtain new foods and increase the amount of meat, tubers, and roots in their diet.",
    "label_text": "There is a long tradition of technical economy, of individual tools performing multiple tasks\u2014the ancient handaxe is an elegant example. It shares design features with the Victorinox@work and iPhone: portability, tactility, and good fit for the hand, yet each of their many functions reflects the particular needs and technology of its era.",
