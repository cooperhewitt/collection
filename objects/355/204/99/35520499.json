    "gallery_text": "Weapons like this Y-shaped throwing knife were used primarily in central Africa, where they served in warfare and for hunting. To be aerodynamically effective, a throwing knife requires a particular height\u2013width ratio and a standardized weight; its handle is covered with a tight-fitting material like braided fiber in order to maintain the instrument\u2019s balance. When thrown, the knife rotates around its center of gravity; the dark color applied to the middle of the blade draws the eye to the sharp edges that reflect the sunlight as the weapon spins toward its target. The most common way to throw this knife was vertically over the shoulder, like a spear or javelin. Most groups\u2019 arsenals in the past also included bows, arrows, and spears. This is one of sixty knives collected by Herbert Ward in the Congo Free State, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, between 1884 and 1889.",
    "label_text": "These multibladed knives, made by professional blacksmiths, served for warfare and hunting, and as axes and currency. To be aerodynamic, a knife required a particular height\u2013width ratio and standardized weight, and the handle was covered with braided fiber to maintain the tool\u2019s balance. Knives were thrown either underhand horizontally from the hip or vertically over the shoulder.",
