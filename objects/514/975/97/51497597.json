    "gallery_text": "Made in Space and NASA partnered to launch the \u201c3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment\u201d on September 23, 2014. Referred to as \u201cthe flying factory,\u201d the goal is to demonstrate manufacturing capabilities in space and free astronauts from their reliance on Earth for basic equipment. Three-D printers use an additive extrusion-based process to build objects layer by layer out of polymers, composites, and other materials. The challenges of designing such a device for space are numerous: the printer must account for the movement, or \u201cfloat,\u201d of components during liftoff and in microgravity, survive vibrations and changes in pressure during launch, and be provided with adequate electrical power and ventilation.  But with the help of this specially designed 3D printer, the current supply chain from Earth to space can be largely bypassed, allowing astronauts to create everything from common instruments to replacement parts.",
    "label_text": "Space missions depend on equipment sent from Earth, but if astronauts can make parts as needed, the supply chain from Earth to space could be largely bypassed. A 3D printer like this, designed for use in microgravity, was sent to the International Space Station (ISS), where it is making the very first objects manufactured off planet Earth.\n\nA copy of this plaque is installed inside the Made In Space 3D printer on the ISS. The logo shows a digital stream of information being broadcast from California to the ISS, demonstrating how digital signals will translate into functional tools off Earth.",
