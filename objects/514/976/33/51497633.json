    "description": "Gesture Match, constructed in three modules, will allow visitors to scan their bodies, view and save their body measurements, and compare their bodies to various norms, such as national average, global average, average height in the 15th century. More narrative possiblities under consideration as well. If possible, we will incorporate body ideals such as Leonardo Man, Neumier Man, and Schlemmer Man into Gesture Match interactive.",

The things and spaces we use are extensions of our proportions, perceptions, abilities, and limitations. Designed by Local Projects, this interactive experience invites visitors to see their own bodies in relation to images sampled from Cooper Hewitt\u2019s historic collection. Since the Renaissance, designers have conceived of cities, buildings, and even letterforms in relation to idealized human proportions.",
