Two square cartouches at the bottom with blue grounds and a basket of fruit between, contain a verse: \n\nTime flies a Pace\nIn ceaseless race\nMan hurries to the tomb\nIn bliss or woe\nEre long to know\nHis everlasting doom\n\nThen let thy heart\nWho ere thou art\nTo wisdoms way incline\nUse well this hour\nWhile in thy Power\nFor the next may not be thine\n\nWith a strawberry vine border  and  inscription. \n\nThe death date for the second Abigail Barnard (daughter) has been written in with ink \"Oct. 2. 1885\" Several of the dates are later than the date given in the signature.",
