    "description": "Vertical sheet with four sketches, clockwise from upper right: dormer; (A) a holy water bucket from a church; a half-timbered fa\u00e7ade; (B) a gable with water-shed.  The dormer has a double arched-top window opening and the roof above the dormer is flat.  The holy water bucket is hung by a twisted bale handle on a projecting bracket of copper or wrought iron made of c-scrolls in a Baroque style.  The buliding fa\u00e7ade at bottom left is the least refined, and is sketched close to the building as the area under the roof tiles and eaves is visible.  The gable with water-shed is more delicately sketched, showing two bulding rooflines, the one in the background having a projecting eave, visible timber construction, and small window openings punctuating its fa\u00e7ades.",
