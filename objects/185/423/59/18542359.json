    "gallery_text": "This atmospheric drawing shows a robed figure of death with a smoking brazier presiding over a tomb cast in a gray wash. Stark shadows describe the geometric forms of a massive sarcophagus and sepulchral niche. The simplicity of the somber interior evokes the proportions of Egyptian architecture, as well as the ancient culture\u2019s fascination with death. Louis-Jean Desprez was an artist of great originality with a distinct taste for the bizarre and macabre. The late eighteenth century saw a growing interest in sublime terror and morbid visions, as reflected in the visual arts and literature. The dramatic lighting and abstracted space of Desprez\u2019s designs were likely inspired by Giovanni Battista Piranesi\u2019s Carceri d'invenzione (Imaginary Prisons) series first published in 1750. In 1776 Desprez went to Rome, where Piranesi\u2019s work was enormously popular. The following year, Desprez traveled to Naples, where he made numerous visits to tombs and catacombs. Four of Desprez\u2019s Egyptian-themed tomb drawings were reproduced as large aquatint prints; the artist was introduced to the intaglio printmaking technique in Rome. He admired aquatint for its capacity to produce soft tonal variations that closely resembled eerie washes of ink. Prints offered Desprez the means to disseminate his experimental architectural designs and to showcase his fertile imagination.",
    "label_text": "Giovanni Piancastelli, a drawing teacher, collector, and curator of the Borghese collection in Rome, disposed of his drawings collection between 1901 and 1907. Using agents in Rome to preview the drawings, the Hewitt sisters recommended that the museum acquire about 3,700 mostly Italian decorative arts and architecture drawings in 1901. In 1938, the museum was able to largely reunite Piancastelli\u2019s decorative drawings collection by acquiring about 8,700 drawings from Mrs. Edward D. Brandegee of Brookline, Massachusetts, who had originally purchased them in 1904.",
