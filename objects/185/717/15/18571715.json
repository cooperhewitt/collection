    "description":"Stylized poppy and leaf design drawn in large, bold, serpentine pattern. This wallpaper is called \"wash print\" because the blue and green colors are semi-transparent. Over the ecru field there is printed in yellow outline a small all-over leaf design. This paper was probably printed by F. Arthur of England. Above information was given by Mr. John W. Morrow, wallpaper authority in New York City.",
