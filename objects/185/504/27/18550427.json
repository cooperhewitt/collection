    "description":"Elevation of a free standing villa.  The central part of the building has two stories, the upper one being octagonal.  Steps are leading to a porch with two Ionic columns.  In the flanking walls is a window and a frieze above it; another one above the door.  Two narrow receding wings project from the walls, each is decorated with a niche occupied by a statue and a frieze.  Additional two statues are standing beside the front window in the upper floor.  At the ground level, at both ends, are somewhat more receding terraces with a balustrade and a fountain, supported by swans standing in a basin as the concluding motif.  The building is elevated on a mass of land",
