There is a door opening framed with Gothic decoration on the ground floor level at right.  The two stories above repeat the Gothic ogee arch of the door opening on both sides of the building. These arches are filled with crossed timber deocration, and frame a set of double windows with window boxes in the center.  The attic story has a small dormer over the windows, and the roof appears to be made of slate and tile.  To the right of this is a section of the fa\u00e7ade elevation.",
