Above is a very light sketch of a colonnaded classical building with triangular pediment, and there is another sketch of intersecting horizontal and vertical members below this, possibly related to the larger sketch of ironwork.  The sheet is made of multiple thickness of paper that seem to have been laminated together. The bottom right corner of the sheet is separating. There are various inscriptions with measurements.",
