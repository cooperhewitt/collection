Two allegorical figures are seated at right and left of the heraldic arms. The figure at right holds two tablets; the left tablet is written in Latin: LIBER\/GENE\/RATIONE\/S\/IESU\/CHRI\/STI; the right is in pseudo-Hebrew. The figure on the left holds a cross. Two putti above holding cords of a cardinal's hat which together with the escutcheon identify the patron Cardinal Giulio della Rovere (1535-1578). A wreath encricles the design.",
