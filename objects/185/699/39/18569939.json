    "description": "Horizontal sheet tipped vertically  into binding, depicting a scaled drawing of the upper story of a building's balcony or loggia seen in elevation and in section, and various parts of it seen in profile.  At left the elevation of the loggia consists of an entablature from the story below supporting a balustrade, likely of white stone or painted wood, upon which stand three ionic columns which then support a slate roof with a gutter of decorative fleurs-de-lys. Below this the gutter is seen in detail, and then also in profile.  The right half of the sheet shows the loggia in section, the underside of its roof beams painted alternating shades of ochre yellow, forest green, and brick red.  Below this is a detailed drawing of one of the balusters, and to the right of this sketch is a view in section and in profile of the painted roof beams.",
