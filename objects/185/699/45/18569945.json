    "description":"Horizontal sheet tipped vertically into binding illustrating a three-story gray and white stone buliding in the Baroque style.  The elevation consists of a central block divided into three equal parts by engaged columns that extend the height of the first and second stories.  There is a green, flat-arched paneled door in the center flanked by a similar, smaller door on either side.  The small wings along each side of the central block have two small round windows at the first floor level, and then repeat the fenestration of the central block: rectangular windows with small circular windows above.  The second story is almost entirely glass.  Inscriptions are written below the drawing on ruled lines.",
