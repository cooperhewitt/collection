    "description":"Vertical sheet that was once folded in half and has a crease across the page which creates two registers occupied by sketches and notations.  The upper half contains a small sketch of engaged columns, a double arch lancet, and a campanile with many inscriptions below and to the right.  The lower half of the sheet contains a sketch of vaulting seen in elevation but drawn upside down on the sheet relative to its orientation in the album.  Sketched across the crease is a small plan, possibly of the campanile in Milan, according to the notation.  All drawings on the sheet contain dimensions. The verso of the sheet contains a drawing in plan on the lower half of an octagonal tile floor in the bedroom of Dianne de Poitiers in the Chateau de Chaumont. This side of the sheet also contains small sections of calculations.",
