There appear to be two women wearing long skirts bent over at the waist while working the ground.  One at left is faces forward, while the woman to the right has her back to the viewer.  There is a group of people a distance from this scene standing off to the right behind a fence.  In the background is the large building with a prominent tower in the front. The tower is similar to a cathedra, a large arched opening on two sides with a pediment above.   An ornamented cupola is at the very top.",
