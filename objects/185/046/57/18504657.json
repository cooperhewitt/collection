    "gallery_text": "Around 1930, Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of then-governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, commissioned Cowan Pottery for a ceramic bowl to be used at a party. Cleveland-born designer Viktor Schreckengost, recently hired by Cowan, submitted designs inspired by the modernity, music, and bustle of Manhattan. Schreckengost used a sgraffito technique, scratching the stylized motifs of advertising signs, skyscrapers, cocktail glasses, instruments, and figures onto a top layer to reveal a preliminary layer below, and finished it with a cobalt-blue glaze that reminded him of the \u201cfunny blue light in New York.\u201d Mrs. Roosevelt subsequently ordered two more bowls, one of which she planned to present to her husband upon winning the presidential election. Cowan and Schreckengost then applied the New York jazz theme to a  range of bowls and plates at varying prices, which had a brief moment of popularity in the 1930s. Cowan shut its doors in 1931, hit by the economic depression, but Schreckengost went on to secure more than a hundred patents during his fifty-year teaching and industrial design careers. When the ceramic series was rediscovered in the 1980s, it was nicknamed Jazz, and this oversized punch bowl quickly became an icon of American Art Deco.",
    "label_text": "In 1931, Eleanor Roosevelt commissioned a bowl to celebrate her husband Franklin's reelection as governor of New York. Produced in a small series, this bowl was designed in Ohio by Schreckengost. His visits to New York City inspired the nightlife motifs and the vibrant-blue glaze that he said evoked the \"funny blue light\" of the city.",
