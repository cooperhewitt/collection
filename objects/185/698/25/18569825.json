    "description":"Vertical sheet divided into two registers, both illustrating windmills.  The upper register depicts two windmills, one seen from the front, the other from the side.  These two sketches focus on the details of the arms of the mill, as well as the method of anchoring them to the tower.  The mill at left consists of a short green single-story wooden structure with low, sloped roof.  Above rises a hexagonal brown tower with a rounded roof and four large wood blades with fabric sails.   The tower has two small rectangular windows and a green deck raised on supports above the single-story structure.  Two large wooden supports are visible at left and right of the mill blades.  A similar mill is seen at right, possibly the same mill as at left, but a single-story structure is not visible below.   The lower register illustrates six windmills with a green field in the foreground.  Their structures are the same as those described above.  More small single-story timber buildings are seen behind each of the windmills.",
