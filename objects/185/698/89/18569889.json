Each panel is framed by a golden yellow molding with the face of the woodwork parallel to the floor colored red.  One panel is further decorated with a single golden yellow ribbon of ornament that doubles upon itself at the corners to create fleur-de-lys of loops.  The artist notes that all the panels bore this decoration.  To the right of this is a section or profile of the molding that frames the panels.",
