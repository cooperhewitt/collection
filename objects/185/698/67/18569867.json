It is a Romanesque tower with blind arcade decoration at the uppermost level, topped by a mansard roof with chimney.  At top right is a dormer that far overhangs the window opening below and ends in a curve.  Underneath the dormer has wooden tracery similar to a flamboyant Gothic style.  At bottom right is the corner of a masonry and half-timbered and plastered house.  The half-timbering is only on the upper story, ending with a small tower in the corner.",
