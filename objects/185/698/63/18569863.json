    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating two sketches of architectural elements.  In the center is the clock tower of the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) of the town of Reims, seen from the south.  The octagonal tower rises from the roofline with multiple graduated arcaded cupolas and is topped by a finial with weathervane.  At bottom right is an unusually intricate dormer.  The dormer projects out from the roof ending in a circle. Underneath this small dome is carved and pierced wood, similar to flamboyent Gothic tracery.  The window opening is framed by two scrolling brackets on either side of the window frame.",
