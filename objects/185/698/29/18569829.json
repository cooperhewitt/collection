    "description":"Vertical sheet depicting a small early Baroque church seen from the west.   The west facade has a semicircular portico with a small clock tower above.  Above the tower is a niche with a statue of a woman holding a child on her left hip. Given the statue's location and the dedication of the church to the Virgin Mary, it is likely a staute of Mary holding Christ on her hip.  The tower is completed by small cupola and finial in the shape of a rooster.  Visible beyond the west entrance are the two buttressed arms of the nave, and small round arched windows of the aisles.",
