The timbering is laid in intricate intersecting patterns, all unique. Below this at left and right are two different types of wood-supported spans.  The one at the right is a very straightforward bracket consisting of two pieces of wood intersecting at a 90-degree angle; the one at left is a detail of the arch in the sketch above.",
