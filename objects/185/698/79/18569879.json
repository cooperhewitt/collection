    "description": "Vertical sheet illustrating tile floor pattern from Chapel at Ch\u00e2teau de Blois. Many of the tiles here are the same as those seen in 1943-51-212, the drawing of the tile floor near the altar in the same chapel.  The majority of the tilework is brick red, possibly in imitation of terra cotta.  At the top left is a group of nine white tiles with brown ornament.  To the right of this is a row of three white tiles with green, yellow and brown quatrefoils, which is separated by one terra cotta tile, and then repeated.  To the right of this is the beginning of what, one assumes, is another group of the nine white tiles seen at top left.  Below this is a blue shield with three yellow fleurs-de-lys on a white ground which is created by nine tiles.  Above and to the bottom left and right of the shield are yellow rosettes.  At the ordinal points from this group of tiles are white tiles with a dark blue fleur-de-lys, although only the upper left corner tile like this has two small yellow dots on either side of the fleur-de-lys.  The rest of the field of tiles surrounding this section are terra cotta tiles.  To the left is a vertical repetition of the three white tiles with green, brown and yellow quatrefoils seen above.  The scale is given at lower right.",
