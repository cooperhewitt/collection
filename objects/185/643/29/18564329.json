Surrounded on four sides with a delicate strawberry vine border. \nThe verse reads: \nCould we with Ink the Ocean fill\nWere the whole earth of parchment made\nWere every single stick a Quill\nAnd every man a scribe by trade\nTo write the Love of GOD above\nWould drain the Ocean dry\nNor could this Scroll contain the whole\nTho stretcht from sky to sky\nWhere the whole realm of nature mine\nThat were a present far too small\nLove so amazing so divine\nDemands my sould my life my all",
