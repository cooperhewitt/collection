    "description": "A bar scene divided vertically in two parts.  In the right half, four women stand against a bar with a large mirror behind.  One inebriated woman, on the left, holds a glass in her right hand while three other women, to the right, holding glasses converse with each other.  In the left half of the scene, one inebriated man looks downward toward the glass in this left hand; to the left another man, viewed from behind, leans on the bar while two other men raise their glasses.  In the lower margin, beneath the men's scene:  All Wrong; beneath the female scene:  All Wrong; in the middle:  Where's the Difference.",
