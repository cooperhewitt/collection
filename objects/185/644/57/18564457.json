    "description":"This paper used in St. James Palace, London, England. It requires two breadths of paper to show the complete repeat. The central motif is a large artichoke enwreathed in oak leaves, directly beneath is another motif, similar in design, but different coloring. At either end is a stylized pomegranate. A twisting vine runs through the design and small vines and leaves and flowers are scattered over the background. The original paper used in St. James Palace is printed on a red field. The design shows a Gothic influence. Used in Throne Room and the Wellington Room. Printed in gray, beige, green and tan on blue field. Portions are also in gold and silver.",
