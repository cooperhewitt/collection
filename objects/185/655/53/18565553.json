    "description":"At the bottom, a fluted shaft rises between two cherubim heads from a circular plinth.  Above is a \"knob\" decorated with drapery festoons supported by two rams' heads (at each side) and a child's head (at center), which supports the form above.  This form shows two masks hanging from the upper spirals of gaine scrolls which are projecting clasp-like (three of these are shown); atop the lateral gaine scrolls are harpy heads, which, together with a pedestal in the center, support a base for the vessel-shaped shaft above.  Flanking this vessel-shaped shaft are two women carrying capitals on their heads; the right one holds a small cross, the left one holds something that cannot be interpreted.  At the top, a circular, domed structure  with steps, upon which two children\/angels are seated at either side.",
