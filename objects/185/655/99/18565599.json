    "description":"At left: design for bowl with swing handle. The handle, decorated with applied female forms, is formed by double arches that are connected in the middle by a ring and are hooked to each side of the bowl's rim between the horns of goats' heads. The bowl's body is ornamented with draped festoons, acanthus leaves and a central female mask with fan diadem. Lower center: Design for small ewer shaped as an armless, elongated female form: her head supports a shell spout; her lower body tapers at the base to a simple circular foot; the handle is formed by forward curving scrolls connecting to the shell and form's back. The body of a vessel is also  lightly sketched in the lower part of the design.  At right (larger in scale): Design for a ewer with neck formed by female torso; a shell spout rests upon her head. The body of  this vessel is relatively plain with bands of gadrooning at the bottom; the vessel rests upon a circular pedestal base; its handle is an elaborately-curved, ribbon-like scroll which connects the shell spout to the shoulder of vessel.  At lower right: Small sketch for variation of the ewer at the right .",
