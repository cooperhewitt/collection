    "description":"Above the door frame is a half circle with a trophy of arms of Cardinal Albani. Above the straight entablature of the door-case, in the center, is a vase with dolphins beside it, and garlands hanging cross-like from the backs of crouching sphinxes. A prior suggestion has been erased. The entablature is richly decorated and subdivided horizontally by consoles with ram's heads. In the frize, in the place of triglyphs, alternate a female herma and two figures beside a cadelabrum. Above, a wall of a pointed vault into which is inscribed a half circle with a shell on top and a mask at the point. In the lunette, the star and the threemount of the Albani upon a pedestal in front of a shell, in the center of a broken pediment on the cornices of which sit satyrs with palm branches. In the door, a lady with a fan, a gentleman - his left hand outstretched - carrying a stick, and a dog.",
