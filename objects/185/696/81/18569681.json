    "description": "Vertical sheet illustrating five sketches of buildings or architectural elements.  Beginning at top left is a simple, timber-frame structure with steeple in the center of the main fa\u00e7ade.  The eaves are ornamented with bargeboard decoration underneath.  At top right is a small ogee canopy over an open casement window.  The canopy appears to be tiled.  This small sketch is identified by the artist as \"Forsbach \/ Valley of the Murg \/ Black Forest\".  At center is a half-timbered building with steeply pitched roof, and the artist has noted a small addition to the corner of the building which is prominently supported by large timbers underneath.  At lower right is a small tower with faceted onion dome cupola and four-sided finial or weathervane.  The drawing at lower left is much larger than the others, and illustrates a shingeled, timber-frame structure with two story tower completed by a tiled steeple with ball finial surmounted by a cross.",
