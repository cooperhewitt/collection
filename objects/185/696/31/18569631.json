    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating a detailed elevation of a three-story house with attic in typical Dutch style.  The building is both timber and masonry construction with eclectic elements.  The house is set back from the cobbled street visible in the foreground.  The ground level consists of two square glazed windows flanking a Dutch door.  The upper half of the door is oopen and a woman wearing a cap and a small cat perched on the lower half of the door are visible.  The secon level has a row of five round-arched windows framed by quoins.  A similar pair of windows flanks a shuttered window opening above.  The 'trapgevel' fa\u00e7ade likely conceals a steeply pitched roof.  Tie rods are visible throughout the masonry sections of the fa\u00e7ade.",
