    "description": "Vertical sheet with frayed bottom and right edge.  Illustrated are sketches of buildings and architectural features.  Beginning from top left are two domed steeples, both with shingled onion-shaped cupolas and tall finials. At right is an elevation of a timbered building with a large, deep gable on both stories which shade open windows with shutters.  In the center is a very small sketch of a dormer within a shingled or tiled roof.  At lower left is likely the same gabled building sketched on the  upper half of the sheet, but now viewed from a corner angle, the gables supported by very large timbers which the artist identifies as being \"at least 3 ft.\"  At lower right is a very quickly sketched tiled or shingled roof with an awkwardly oversize \"bell\" cupola, as it is named by the artist.  The cupola projects from the roof on a very thin support, and balloons above it.  The cupola is shingled, and terminates in a small ball finial with weathervane.",
