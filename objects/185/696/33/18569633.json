    "description": "Six sketches arranged on a vertical sheet. At top left a wood-hulled riverboat is viewed from the side, and also from the bow and stern.  Below this is a sketch of the date 1600, the numerals formed by  pieces of ironwork with prominent joints.  To the right, a late Gothic style tracery window which the artist notes was created with brick and not stone.  Above at right are two sketches of a chain with ring- and diamond-shaped links.  The diamond-shaped links have spiked projections on either flat side of the link, making it, as the artist notes, difficult upon which to sit.",
