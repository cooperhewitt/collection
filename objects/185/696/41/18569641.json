    "description": "Horizontal sheet bound vertically in album.  Study of many windmills in an open, marshy landscape.  In the foreground are short grasses.  At a further distance in the midground is a large windmill at center right, seen from the side.  The mill consists of an octagonal central tower that graduates in diameter until  it is capped by a rounded roof from which large blades spin.  Two large supports buttress the roof and are anchored into the short story beneath the tower.  This tower and another to its right bear a striped flag with three bands of color - the center band is lighter than the upper and lower bands.  Similar mills are seen along the horizon.",
