    "description":"Vertical sheet depicting a large, eclectically adorned masonry Romanesque structure with later additions.  The building's main elevation terminates in a corner, while the rest of the building is rounded toward the rear.  Very small timber-frame structures are seen in the foreground.  The building's character is in keeping with the Northern Renaissance style: it has a steeply pitched roof culminating in a large, four-sided clocktower with a galleried, octagonal double cupola and tall ornamental finial.  The fa\u00e7ade's lower elevation consists of a row of blind trefoils, a row of small windows above, and another small blind arcade before the attic story.  There are turrets at the fa\u00e7ade corners, and another in the center of the fa\u00e7ade upon which sits a unicorn bearing the arms of the town of Hoorn.  A date plaque above reads 1532-1651 in a banner.  Visible at the rear of the building is a rounded fa\u00e7ade with blind arcade.",
