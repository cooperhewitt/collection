    "description": "Vertical sheet with two sketches: above, a Romanesque cathedral tower with noticeable additions.  The tower's fa\u00e7ade is articulated by three tall lancet window openings with louvers (possibly containing a bell within).  A small arcaded tracery balustrade is below.  Above the lancets is a broken pediment that projects upward, surmounted by ball finials at the three corners of the pediment.  At right is another finial; at left, a short masonry element supporting a flag.   This story has a small gallery that projects forward.  Beneath these projections are tall, slender masonry supports creating an openwork lancet.  The drawing on the lower half of the sheet is a detailed sketch of a Baroque doorway.  The doors are framed by an arch with quoins and doric columns supporting a thick cornice. Above each column is a lion facing the other.  The fa\u00e7ade continues behind them: a broken pediment is raised up ending in a semicircular cap.  Large c-scrolls at either side further define the imposing pediment.  Behind this is the continuation of a wall with a gallery at right.",
