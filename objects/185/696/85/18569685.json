There are two windows with triangular pediments, and the top of the fa\u00e7ade projects upward to a pedestal upon which stands the sculpture of a figure.  At right is a very simple tower surmounted by an onion dome with a smooth surface only interrupted by a small chimney stack.  Without interruption, the top of the dome becomes an octagonal steeple with tall finial and decorative banner or weathervane at its top.",
