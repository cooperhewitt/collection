    "description": "Six sketches arranged on vertical sheet.  At top left, two sketches of finials: one is a ball mounted with a crescent moon; the other is in the shape of an obelisk.  At right, a three-story masonry house with steeply pitched, tiled roof, an elaborate 'trapgevel' fa\u00e7ade in the Dutch manner.  Above the second story is a date plaque on either end of the fa\u00e7ade: ANNO 1623, with the initials of the original owner in the center of the plaque.  The upper story was likely added to a three-over-three configuartion of the earlier building at the first and second stories.  The upper window is framed by quoins of large blocks with two small, similarly detailed round-arched windows above.  Tie rods decorate the upper levels of masonry while the lower half of the fa\u00e7ade has a bracketed cornice below the date plaque.  To the left of this sketch are two details of the brackets on the same house.  They are in full Mannerist strapwork style and are seen both in elevation and from the side.   Above this is a small sketch of a cartouche of the shield of Leiden in the form of a lion with yawning mouth sitting upright presenting a shield with crossed keys.",
