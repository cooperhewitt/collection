    "gallery_text": "Before the sixteenth century, European men and women, boys and girls, wore gowns, robes, or tunics. But around 1550, men began to wear bifurcated garments, while women and children remained in skirted styles. In the early eighteenth century, small children of both sexes wore dresses with tailored bodices and ankle-length skirts, like the dress seen here, once they started crawling and later walking. Under these dresses, young girls and also many young boys wore foundation garments known as stays, which were said to support the back and encourage good posture.\nGirls would continue to wear dresses of this style until they were about thirteen or fourteen, when they assumed the clothing of adult women. Boys, on the other hand, would adopt men\u2019s clothing after a rite of passage known as breeching sometime between the ages of four and eight.",
