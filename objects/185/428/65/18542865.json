    "description": "Two elevations of long horizontal buildings.  Positioned horizontally, one on top of the other; the bottom project suggests a greater length than the top one.  The top project has a slightly projecting central section of nine bays and lateral sections of three bays each.  The bottom project has a central section of seven bays and pairs of lateral sections of three bays each.  In both buildings, the central sections show embedded fluted Doric columns supporting an entablature with triglyph friezes.  In each intercolumnar space are a window and a relief.  They depict classical scenes.  The lengths are inscribed in the bases of the buildings.  \nA section, in pencil, beside the top design shows the top storey as a sham one.",
