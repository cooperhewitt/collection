    "description":"Horizontal sheet cut down from a larger size, with pinholes at the top corners.  Depicted is the statue of a lion seated on a large pedestal seen from the side. The pedestal consists of a thick cornice supported by two inverted pillars (like balusters) at either corner.  In the center is a panel with a fleur-de-lys in a wreath and festoons of ribbons coming out from all four corners of the wreath. Other sketches on the sheet depict various details of the ornament on the pedestal, with inscriptions identifying them (clockwise from top left): cornice, architrave moulding, shield, column, pillars, fleur de lys, part of wreath, shields and festoon.  These are all tinted cream to pale beige, as if to imply marble.  The lion is a soft gray-green, implying either a patinated metal or stone surface.",
