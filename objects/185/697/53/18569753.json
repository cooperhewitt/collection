    "description": "Vertical sheet with three sketches.  At upper left is a basin with four pieces of twisted ironwork rising above it.  These curve up and on each other, twist together, and then separate again into two lily blossoms and a third unopened blossom at the top.  Attached to the twisted section at the top is a letter S.  To the right and below are sketches of roundels or tondi depicting figures against a segmented blue ground.  The one at top right is wearing a brown wrap that is bound with white cloth or ribbon.  Below this is another roundel or tondo of similar configuration, but the wrap is teal blue.  Both of these figures have their arms outstretched.  The figure in the roundel below left only has one arm outstretched and the reddish-orange wrap is instead around the figure's feet and lower legs.",
