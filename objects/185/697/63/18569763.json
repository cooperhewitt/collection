    "description": "Vertical sheet consisting of three main sketches, all elements of ironwork at the monastery of San Marco.  Above is a gate rendered in detail only from above and at upper right.  The gate is made up of long vertical members that have scroll ornament and terminate in a leaf-like end.  The upper section of the gate has three large connected scrolls.  This sketch is scaled.  To the right of this drawing is a sketch of the bolt that presumably locks the gate.  At bottom right is a drawing of a window screen or grille also made of iron.  Its members intersect to form a screen, while the vertical members protrude past the top of the screen and alternate ending in a leaf or fleur-de-lys.  This drawing is also scaled.  At bottom left is the top of a gate with a pod-shaped element with lobes around its sides, and it is topped by a spiky crown.  To the right of it are smaller ironwork details.",
