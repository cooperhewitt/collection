The sarcophagus has a very high base with a panel above of carved vegetal swags tied to the corners by carved ribbons.  In the upper center of the panel is a small plaque that reads: LVSIENAE \/ PRIMICENIAE \/ VIX  ANN XXV.  The cover has a large triangular pediment with two confronted scrolls joined at the apex.  The ends of the scrolls extend high above the corners of the pediment.  The elevation of the sarcophagus at right shows a panel with a garland suspended from the top corners.  Above the ends of the cover are seen as two bellflowers end to end.",
