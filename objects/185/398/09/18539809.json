The lowest portion is a base, with the inscription: CE MONUMENT QUI PAROIT ETRE UN TOMBEAU A  ETE CONSTRUIT EN 1425 DANS L'EGLISE\/DES BENEDICTINS DE FESCAMP EN NORMANDIE SOUS LES ORDRES DE ROBERT CHARDI.  Above the base is a wide frieze, divided into three parts by short piers and decorated with arabesque designs and coats of arms (possibly).  In the central section of the monument, at the center, in relief, is a depiction of a woman.  The image is framed and positioned between two piers (decorated).  On either side of this central grouping is a candelabrum in relief.  On the base of the left candelabrum the inscription reads: ROUEN; while on the base of the right candelabrum it reads: VERNON.  The top of the monument includes a balustrade with two carved panels and a central, arched frame in which a bust of a bearded man above an eagle is crowned by two genii, who stand beside it and hold a festoon in front of the bust",
