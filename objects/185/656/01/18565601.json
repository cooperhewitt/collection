The curving body of a long-necked winged harpie rests beneath the spout or prow of the ship.  A harpie or female half-figure at the stern curves outward; her tail curves behind her to form the vessel's handle.  The central body of the vessel displays a figural frieze.  Other decorative elements include a ram's head (in the center) and an eye (towards the stern of the vessel).  On verso, pen and ink framing lines along right and left edges and across upper edge.",
