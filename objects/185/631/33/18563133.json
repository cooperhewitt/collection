    "description": "Blue silk satin skirt embroidered in colored silks with a design of flowers and birds; trimmed with black satin bands and black silk braid. Waistband of white linen lined with pink silk woven with a fret pattern. The skirt is made in two parts designed to wrap around the body, with straight panels in the front and back and pleated sections at each side.",

    "gallery_text": "Chinese skirt styles are often called aprons and are typically comprised of two identical sections, each with a decorated panel, a side panel and a pleated or gored panel. They were worn overlapping, wrapped around the body and secured through fabric loops and knotted buttons. The sections were attached to a wide waistband, usually made of cotton or hemp so that the silken fabric of the skirt would not slip down. Only Han women wore skirts, not the Manchu women of the ruling Qing dynasty, and they were worn on formal occasions together with trousers and jackets. This explains why the panels were only embroidered to where the jacket meets the skirt. \n \nThis skirt is embroidered with phoenixes set amid flowers and scrolling borders. This skirt style is known as the ma mian qun \u99ac\u9762\u88d9(horse face skirt) but skirts were subject to numerous fashion changes, many of which revolved around their very poetic names. The seventeenth-century dramatist and commentator Li Yu\u674e\u6f01 (1611-1680?) wrote of how, \u201cRecently in Suzhou the fashionable \u2018hundred pleated skirt\u2019 (bai jian qun\u767e\u8947\u88d9) is considered very beautiful.\u2026 but there is a new style, the so-called \u2018moonlight skirt\u2019 (yue hua qun\u6708\u83ef\u88d9) \u2013 with many colors set within each pleat, as if reflecting the light of a brightly lit moon.\u201d During the late nineteenth-century, another fashionable style was the \u2018fish-scale\u2019 skirt, with hundreds of tiny pleats, each secured with horizontal stitches that divided the pleats into sections resembling fish scales.",
