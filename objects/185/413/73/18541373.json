    "description": "Horizontal rectangle consisting of two separate pieces of paper. The left side of the central part was missing; it was later added when the drawing was mounted. Three steps lead up to the altar, which is flanked by pilasters. At the top there is a high and richly molded decorated ledge, which projects laterally. In the center is a scrollwork frame, which shows three cherubim on an oval-shaped tabernacle door. Above the frame is a pedestal ornamented with angels and clouds. Two adult angels lean against either side of the ledge. Each angel is holds a wreath; the angel on the right also holds a palm branch. A vase stands beside the left angel.",
