    "description":"Design for a ceiling.  More than one quarter of a ceiling is shown, viewed from below.  It is a view of a slightly vaulted ceiling with arches at the corners (one arch shown, at the lower left corner).  Visible through the arch is a view of a classical colonnade in ruins.  Decorated beams frame the panels.  A cupola is in the central panel.  In the panels adjacent to the arches are two festoons, crossing each other at the short sides; a candelabrum at the long sides.  In the central panel at the long sides (upper left corner of the sheet) stands a displayed eagle upon a festoon.",
