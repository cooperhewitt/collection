    "justification": "\nJorge Lizarazo is the owner and founder of Hechizoo, a textile firm based in Colombia. Lizarazo originally worked as an architect, which has influenced his textiles in terms of structural clarity and use of materials.&amp;nbsp; His designs also benefit from his staff, who &amp;nbsp;bring with them an expertise in the rich weaving traditions of their region. He trains his staff to work with new and unusual materials that complement the often understated and basic textile structure. Man-made materials such as wire, nylon, and polyester ribbon are integrated with natural materials such as silk, agave, cumare, and penca to create contemporary but sophisticated products. In Marea, he weaves black nylon and copper to make a coal-black blanket that shimmers and reflects the surrounding light. Intended as a decorative panel or window curtain, Marea and other textiles by Hechizoo are meant to interact with the interior spaces, not overpower them, much in the spirit of the Bauhaus master weavers, Anni Albers and Gunta St\u00f6lzl.
