    "justification": "Jorge Lizarazo is the owner and founder of Hechizoo, a textile firm based in Colombia. Lizarazo\u2019s original work as an architect has influenced his textiles in terms of structural clarity and use of materials. His designs also benefit from Hechizoo\u2019s team members, who contribute expertise in the rich weaving traditions of their region. Lizarazo trains his staff to work with new and unusual materials that complement the often understated and basic textile structure. Man-made materials, such as wire, nylon, and polyester ribbon, are integrated with natural materials, such as silk, agave, cumare, and penca, to create contemporary but sophisticated products. \nIn Marea, Lizarazo weaves black nylon and copper to make a coal-black blanket that shimmers and reflects the surrounding light. Intended as a decorative panel or window curtain, Marea and other textiles by Hechizoo, are meant to interact with the interior spaces, not overpower them\u2014much in the spirit of the Bauhaus master weavers, Anni Albers and Gunta St\u00f6lzl.\nAlthough the museum\u2019s collection includes historical examples of Colombian textiles, the work proposed for acquisition would be one of the first pieces from Colombia designed in the 21st century.",
