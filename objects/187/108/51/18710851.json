    "description": "Dramatic view of interior of Saint Peter's in Rome on Holy Thursday.  View is from the right transept looking into the nave in which a large cross is suspended from the dome, composed of several hundred candles.  Beneath the cross in the nave stand numerous figures; others stand and kneel in the transept.  The illumination from the cross casts areas of light as well as dark shadows on the vaulted ceilings and walls.",
    "justification": "This dramatic scene of the interior of Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica depicts tourists and worshipers viewing the large cross (eight meters high and incorporating 628 oil lamps) that was displayed annually during the celebration of the Holy Week preceding Easter. The drawing is attributed to the French-born architect and painter Louis Jean Desprez. \nDesprez was trained as an architect at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale d\u2019Architecture, where he was a pupil of Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel and Pierre Desmaison. In 1776, he won the Prix de Rome and went to study at the French Academy the following year. Through the Academy director, Joseph-Marie Vien, Desprez was hired by the Abb\u00e9 de Saint-Non to accompany him as draftsman through Sicily and Naples to provide illustrations for Saint-Non\u2019s book Voyage pittoresque ou description des royaumes de Naples et de Sicilie (Paris, 1781\u201386). After the completion of the tour in 1779, Desprez remained in Rome where he collaborated with the printmaker Francesco Piranesi on a series of hand-colored etchings of Roman and other Italian views. The proposed drawing is related to this project. In 1784, Desprez accepted the initiation of King Gustav III of Sweden to design theatrical decorations for the Royal Opera House in Stockholm. Eight years later, he was made First Architect of the King and worked on many projects for royal residences. His patronage ended when Gustav was assassinated. Desprez died penniless in 1804.\nDesprez was an original and facile draftsman with a great imagination. King Gustav is purported to have said, \u201cThere are only two people in Sweden who have imagination, Desprez and I.\u201d Desprez\u2019s taste bent toward the exotic, the fantastic, and occasionally the macabre. The stranger side of the designer may be seen in four drawings of \u201cimaginary sepulchers\u201d in the Egyptian style in the museum\u2019s collection (1938-88-3950\/3953).\nThe popularity of this dramatic subject brought many artists to Saint Peter\u2019s to produce drawings and prints for tourist consumption, including Francesco Panini, whose drawing of the subject is also proposed for acquisition. The two sheets, as an ensemble, would make a wonderful comparison for anyone working on Roman views by Piranesi and his contemporaries.",
    "gallery_text": "During the Holy Week preceding Easter, the enormous cross suspended from the dome of St. Peter\u2019s basilica in Rome was illuminated with hundred candles, an event that attracted crowds of the faithful and curious tourists throughout the eighteenth century. The dramatic spectacle appealed to artists who produced drawing and prints of the subject for consumption by Grand Tourists. Desprez collaborated with the printmaker Francesco Piranesi, who etched and hand-colored a version of this scene.",
