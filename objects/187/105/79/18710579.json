    "justification": "The Dutch-born award-winning designer Tord Boontje, is a graduate of both the Design Academy in Eindhoven and the Royal College of Art in London. His interior architecture and exhibition designs include both unique and limited edition pieces, commissions for museums like the Victoria and Albert in London, and work for retailers as varied as Target and Herm\u00e8s. Boontje\u2019s numerous mass-produced designs include textiles for Kvadrat and tableware for Salviati. Boontje's work is held by major museums.\nThe Garland light represents an intersection of Boontje\u2019s interest in pattern-making and textiles. Designed to be mass produced in various metal finishes and colors, each lamp is a pliable garland with no fixed shape. The photographically-etched stainless steel can be draped and layered around a light bulb according to the owner\u2019s whim. Garland exemplifies a growing trend among designers to create works that can be customized by the end user.\nThe proposed acquisition of Garland in two metal finishes would augment the museum\u2019s holdings of contemporary Dutch design and would help to bring the lighting collection into the 21st century. The Garland light will also be included in the forthcoming Cooper-Hewitt exhibition Rococo: The Continuing Curve, 1730\u20132008.",
