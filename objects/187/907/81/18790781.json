Continents, map grid, and continent and ocean names picked out in gold; gold-tone volume and tuning dials mounted on equator-like metal band encircling globe; small retangular station number read-out in center; gold-tone terminals at north and south pole positions. Two sides of base with vertical slits and fabric for speakers. Fabric-covered cord.",
    "justification": "Raymond Loewy was one of the most prominent industrial designers in the United States. A French \u00e9migr\u00e9, Loewy began practicing in the new field of industrial design in New York City in the 1920s, where he was recognized as \u201cboth artist and engineer.\u201d[1] As a young child in Paris, Loewy observed how technological developments such as the automobile, the airplane, the phonograph, and the telephone, transformed everyday life. These transformations had a profound effect on the designer. Later, when Raymond witnessed the birth of radio, he would combine both his personal experience and views of the modern world into his designs, such as this New World radio designed for the Colonial Radio Company in the early 1930s.\nIn 1933, Fortune magazine described the New World radio as \u201cthe latest radio success\u201d that aligned with the \u201ccurrent fad for globes in gift and drug stores, yet sells in the high price range.\u201d The radio was the union of Loewy\u2019s technical skills acquired from working at Westinghouse, as well as the use of the new material called Catalin (Bakelite), a very hard, heat resistant phenolic plastic that could be dyed different colors, filed, ground, cut, and polished to a high sheen. \nThe globe-shaped radio depicts the seven continents, but omits individual country names. It was available in three different color combinations: black and gold, maroon and gold, and ivory and gold. The ivory and gold option was considered the \u201ctop of the line.\u201d The radio\u2019s speaker was located in the base; the metal ring played a dual role\u2014one as the decorative indication of the earth\u2019s equator and the other as the functional connector of the two metal knobs that controlled the power, volume, and station tuning. Advertisements deemed the radio \u201cthe ultimate in design.\u201d The New World radio was a commercial success despite its high price point of $60 during the Great Depression. By using a globe\u2019s shape and decoration, Loewy linked listening to the radio with the modern notion of connecting to the world. The radio\u2019s form also alludes to the globe as a decorative motif in historical decorative arts, such as Renaissance automata like celestial globes with clockwork.\nThe New World radio would be the earliest object to join the museum\u2019s Loewy holdings. At the time of proposed acquisition, the museum\u2019s collection of Loewy\u2019s prodigious output includes design drawings, his Purma camera (1937), a range of ceramics for Rosenthal (ca. 1951\u201353), and dining ware and cutlery for the Air France Concorde (late 1970s). The New World radio also relates to other objects in the collection, including early 20th-century Bakelite radios and a highly detailed Swedish globe-form silver clock (ca. 1930) by Erik Fleming.\n[1] Alden Jewell Edward, \"No News Is Cool News\" New York Times, June 2, 1929.",
