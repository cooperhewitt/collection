    "justification": "Eugene V. and Clare E. Thaw\u2019s generous gift of their collection of architectural models for staircases will be the subject of a forthcoming Cooper-Hewitt exhibition. \nThis is one of 10 meticulous staircase schematic drawings from the Thaw collection, presented as a gift to accompany the staircase models. The drawings are by Adolph Bordeaux, a journeyman of the compagnonnage movement doing his master tour in the 1880s. \nBordeaux\u2019s rigorous training is evidenced by the accuracy and precision of these scale drawings. Initially, the journeyman candidate worked for five to seven years perfecting all aspects of the craft\u2014in this case, the joinery associated with constructing spiral staircases\u2014from the planning and drafting to the construction of the models. He would then continue his education with travel to various cities in France to study specific details from master craftsmen. This cycle of travel from city to city was known as Le Tour de France. In each city, the candidate would design and construct an elaborate model of the type specifically associated with the master craftsman of that city. The last step for the student, when he would be considered compagnon fini, was the production of a finished construction of such elaborate design and excellence that he would be granted the title Compagnon du Tour de France. \nEach Bordeaux drawing is annotated with the name of the city that hosted him and the date of the execution of the design. It is thereby possible to trace the duration and scope of Bordeaux\u2019s Tour de France. The Compagnonnage Guild still exists and, periodically, the group publishes books and catalogs detailing the construction of fine joinery and woodworking projects. Their specific goal is to resurrect fine craftsmanship and to continue a tradition of excellence that is in danger of disappearing. \nL\u2019art du menuisier, the multivolume work by Andr\u00e9-Jacob Roubo\u2014cited by Sarah Coffin in the label text that will accompany the Thaw collection exhibition as germane to the tradition of compagnonnage\u2014is part of our Decloux collection of ornament and architectural prints. The museum\u2019s collection is noted for its extensive collection of drawings for architectural projects; these highly-accomplished, detailed drawings will be a wonderful complement to the museum\u2019s existing holdings.",
