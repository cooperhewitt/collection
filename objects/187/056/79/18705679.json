    "description": "Pause has an 18 inch vertical repeat which consists of two nearly identical rows. The one row contains three periods followed by a comma, then by a space. The second row contains a space, then three periods followed by a comma. Printed in the orange colorway the design contains white commas and periods.",
    "justification": "Pause (2004) is from 2x4\u2019s Chatter collection of wallcoverings produced by KnollTextiles. With its pattern of repeating large-scale commas and periods, Pause plays with elements of typography. Typography has been used as a motif in wallpaper design since the 1920s, reaching its peak in the 1960s. Earlier examples tend to involve more words and phrases, while designs from the 1960s begin featuring typographic characters as motifs. Typography was used much earlier on children\u2019s papers, but served an educational rather than decorative purpose. French artist Jean Lur\u00e7at inserted Dada messages into some of his wallpaper designs in the 1920s. The most well-known example of type used as a motif on wallpaper is the design by Alexander Girard for Herman Miller in 1953. While the use of typography as a decorative element has been around for a while, this design shows it being used in a unique way and helps demonstrate the evolution of type as a motif. Although Pause plays with elements of typography, it does so with characters rarely highlighted in wallcoverings. \n2x4 is a New York based design company founded in 1994 that works in practically all graphic media. Their interior and signage design was included in the 2003 National Design Triennial, and they were finalists in the 2005 and 2006 National Design Awards in the category of Communications Design. Some of the firm\u2019s clients include Prada New York, Vitra, the Illinois Institute of Technology, the Brooklyn Museum, and The Studio Museum of Harlem.\n2x4 follows a long history of artists and designers being commissioned to put their work, usually a signature piece or style, into a repeating pattern. This is reflected in the large group of wallcoverings created by artists, designers, and architects already in the museum\u2019s collection. In addition to the papers by Girard for Herman Miller, we also have several examples in the collection of large-scale type overlapping in a seemingly random pattern used on murals in the late 1960s, as well as examples by German artist Cuno Fischer in 1959 that combine illustration with typography.",
