    "description": "One layer of a knitted fabric is stretched under tension. A layer of polyester chiffon is layered on top. An adhesive is screen printed on in a pattern, permeating both fabric layers. Rayon fibers are sprinkled on and made to stand up as pile using an electric charge (flocking). The tension is released on the lower layer of fabric, causing the chiffon layer to pucker all around the flocked motifs. (a) is black with light green chiffon and black flocking; (b) is black with white chiffon and tan flocking.",
    "justification": "In Pedocal, Yoshihiro Kimura combines seemingly disparate materials to create an entirely new surface. He affixes polyester chiffon to a base of stretched knitted fabric. An acrylic binder screen printed on the surface in a pattern permeates the fabrics, causing them to join. Rayon fibers are affixed to this binder and, using an electric charge called flocking, they are made to stand vertically. The knitted fabric that had been stretched during this whole process is then released, leaving the double-layered cloth puckered and covered with flocked crevices.\nKimura is among the first generation of contemporary Japanese textile designers who, in the 1980s, were interested in experimenting with and modifying traditional techniques and fibers to make innovative fabrics. Like many in his field, Kimura comes from a textile family. After graduating from the University of Toyama, he worked in his father\u2019s textile business. The business later specialized in flock printing, and diversified to include other printing techniques, such as those using resin and pigment. Kimura has worked with such well-known fashion designers as Kansai Yamamoto and Issey Miyake.\nThe proposed acquisition of Pedocal would help the museum build a strong core of contemporary textiles, an area specifically targeted for acquisition. The contemporary textiles currently held by the museum, which include other Japanese works, reflect some of the best textiles made during the late 20th and early 21st century. Studying these textiles will add to an understanding of current Japanese design and technology.",
