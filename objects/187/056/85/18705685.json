    "description": "Large cloth composed of narrow woven strips, each horizontally striped in many colors.",
    "justification": "The strip-woven cloths of the Asante and Ewe peoples of Western Africa, in present-day Ghana and Togo, are made exclusively by men on portable, drag-weighted looms. The weaving of plain white strips by men for use as currency goes back hundreds of years; most of the textiles produced are plain white or decorated with simple indigo stripes or checks. A small number of highly colored and patterned prestige cloths, however, commonly known as kente cloth, are produced to be worn for important religious and ceremonial events. The cloths are worn toga-style by both men and women.\n \nWhile the width of the woven strips may vary from 1 to 15 inches, they are most commonly 3\u00bd to 5 inches. The weaver makes a single continuous strip that is then cut into lengths and sewn together selvedge to selvedge to form a wider cloth. Designs are created by incorporating colored threads in the warp to produce vertical stripes, adding colored threads in the weft to make checks, using colored threads of a heavier weight in the weft to create horizontal stripes, or by supplementary weft patterning (brocading). The finished cloths often have a basket-like or checkerboard effect from the alternation of vertically- and horizontally-striped areas, sporadically enhanced with brocaded motifs.\n  \nThe early 20th-century textile under consideration is most similar to an Ewe type called gbeski susuavor, indicating that \u201call design and art came into play\u201d because there are no areas of simple warp (vertical) striping. This means that the entire piece is composed of combinations of weft (horizontal) stripes. In lieu of the traditional checkerboard effect there is a constant interplay of horizontal elements across the strips. Warp striping is simpler but also unvarying, because the loom is warped only once. The weft is inserted by hand, so each color choice is at the discretion of the weaver. This piece also has particularly subtle coloration and fine weaving.",
    "gallery_text": "Prestige cloths, or kente cloths, are one of West Africa\u2019s most important forms of visual expression. Worn at religious celebrations, festivals, and life transition events, the cloth\u2019s voluminous size, lively patterning, and rich, warm palette of golds and pinks ensure a majestic appearance. \nThe cloth is initially woven in one long, narrow strip. It is then cut into pieces of equal length that are sewn together side to side. Kente cloth normally alternates warp- and weft-faced patterning. This titriku, or \u201cthick cloth\u201d is distinguished by being composed entirely of weft-faced stripes, a design common to the coastal area of Ghana.[1] Since warp patterns are faster to weave, this must have been very slow work for a highly-skilled colorist. \n\n\n\n\n[1] Kraamer, \u201cGhanaian Interweaving in the Nineteenth Century,\u201d 52, fig. 23.",
