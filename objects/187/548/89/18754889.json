    "description": "Rectangular digital watch with bevel-edged black-enameled stainless steel bezel on wide, flat, black rubber strap terminating in black-enamelled stainless steel band ; four flat, rectangular fuction buttons on bezel; the word MINI on one side of read out, T2, TM, AL, on the other. Digital read out can be changed from horizontal to vertical orientation.",
    "justification": "In 2001, the automobile manufacturer BMW commissioned Swiss industrial designer, Yves B\u00e9har, to develop accessories around the Mini Cooper, a car the company was reintroducing 43 years after its debut. Instead of resorting to key rings and similar objects as logo-based status symbols, B\u00e9har created a group of highly practical objects and apparel intended to appeal not just to Mini owners, but to consumers who wanted to experience the brand in terms of design and utility\u2014in or out of a car. \nThe simple, minimal form of the Mini_motion watch emphasizes B\u00e9har\u2019s intent to create \u201cfunctionality around the notion of movement, accentuating [a] sporty yet designed feel.\" The watch features a large digital LCD display that can be changed from vertically-oriented numbers to larger horizontal numerals with the push of one of the small function buttons flanking the display. This facilitates readability when positioning the arm for different activities such as holding a steering wheel while driving, grasping handlebars while riding a bicycle, or simply walking. The wide, cuff-like, spring steel wristband is open at one end, making it easy to slip the watch on and off. The soft rubber covering is comfortable against the skin. The watch shows B\u00e9har\u2019s concern with function and ease of use as primary design factors, rather than appearance. \nB\u00e9har was the 2004 National Design Award winner in the category of Product Design. Based in San Francisco, he and the firm he founded in 1999, fuseproject, are known for blending design and brand development, and for designing objects grounded in a conceptual narrative inspired by the user\u2019s experience. B\u00e9har is a versatile designer, at ease experimenting with new concepts, clients, materials, and technologies. He has produced a wide spectrum of work, as can be seen in the range of his designs shown in Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s exhibition celebrating the 10th anniversary of the National Design Awards, Design USA: Contemporary Innovation; these include B\u00e9har\u2019s luxurious chandelier for Swarovski and his Mini_motion watch, a product that exemplifies his dedication to creating design for the mass market. \nThis watch is a fitting addition to the museum\u2019s contemporary technology holdings, as well as the category of timepieces.",
