    "description": "In a circular pattern, blue-violet foliate decoration in concentric circles; on one of the interior circles, text in white: THIS BEING THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF POSTERS, FEATURING AN EXALTATION OF PROTEAN ORNAMENT AND OTHER FANCY STUFF \/ WHEREIN MEDIAEVAL METAL MEETS PSYCHEDELIC NEO-VICTORIANA, ALL SURROUNDING A GOOEY CENTER OF EARTHWORMS. Along left edge: design illustration by \/ MARIAN BANTJES; available at: QUATRIFOLIO.COM \/ or contact \/ MB@",
    "justification": "In this poster by Marian Bantjes, the influence of The Grammar of Ornament by Owen Jones is evident, as are more direct sources such as Islamic writing and arabesque ornament. The text refers to the many influences that have shaped Bantjes\u2019s design aesthetic, including gothic lettering, Arts and Crafts, rococo, baroque, art nouveau, psychedelia, and dimensional typography. The complexity of her personality comes together here in a unique and experimental way. \nA trend in contemporary design is the reexamination of the use of ornament as a counterpoint to the traditional clarity of the grid. Bantjes mines the history of calligraphy, type design, ornament, and oriental symbols and enlivens their compositions. Self-consciously autobiographical in tone, Bantjes' elaborate samplings of images, flourishes, and fonts take graphic design in a fresh new direction.",
