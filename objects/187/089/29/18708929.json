    "justification": "Joris Laarman\u2019s Heatwave radiator is an exuberant combination of decorative form and functionality. According to Laarman, \u201cThis project was a search for ornate but somehow necessary form. Modernistic functionality and post modernistic effusiveness do not have to exclude each other. Heatwave demonstrates that functionalists are also sinners of styling, and that soberness is not always more functional than highly decorative form. A radiator needs a surface as large as possible to lose its heat radiation. Ornamental and highly decorative form has a surface that is larger than sober conventional radiators. Using this aspect this decorative radiator is functioning better or as good as a normal radiator.\u201d[1]\nIn 1998, after one year of fine arts courses, Laarman began his study at the Design Academy Eindhoven. He graduated in 2003, the same year he gained notice with his award-winning radiator, Heatwave, which has been acquired by international museums. Also in 2003, he started his own independent firm, Joris Laarman Studio, which focuses on product design and architecture, often combining a conceptual and poetic approach with style and engineering. In addition to the studio\u2019s inimitable projects, Laarman has also created works for well-known international industrial design companies such as Droog, Flos, Artecnica, and Swarovski. \n[1] \u201cHeatwave,\u201d Joris Laarman, http:\/\/www.jorislaarman.com\/heatwave.html",
