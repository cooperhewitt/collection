    "description": "Cylindrical form with loop handle; yellow ground with pink copper luster decoration of bird sitting on branch above foliage; luster band at mouth. Yellow interior.",
    "justification": "This mug is an example of yellow ground ware, which was produced by Spode and other English factories and exported to continental Europe starting in the late 18th century. The demand abroad inspired production in France, most notably at Creil, which lends its name to this type of work, as well as at S\u00e8vres. The technique of copper luster work with the yellow dates back to Renaissance Italian and Spanish maiolica; it was very popular in England and the United States in the early to mid-19th century.\nThis example comes to the museum as part of a larger collection of yellow ground ware. The collection represents a broad range of styles, and will greatly expand our ability to tell the history of ceramics and the flow of design influences.",
