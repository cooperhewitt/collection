Together with a white gold chain.",
    "justification": "This is a good example of the use of enamel in Faberg\u00e9 jewelry. This piece is marked by Faberg\u00e9 workmaster August Fredrick Hollming. Born in Finland, Hollming was a workmaster in St. Petersburg from 1880 until his death. He produced gold and silver boxes, some with enamel work; on occasion, he also produced enameled jewelry, of which this is a fine example. The quality of the central diamond is high, which is appropriate to the design. \nThe shape of the pendant relates closely to recently discovered and published drawings from the St. Petersburg Archives. This piece demonstrates high quality use of engine-turning under enamel, relating to the techniques of snuffboxes produced in Switzerland and France in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, of which the museum has a few examples. This piece also augments and complements the Faberg\u00e9 gold iris pendant (1995-15-6), enamel pendant egg (1995-15-2), and gold and jeweled brooch (1995-15-5) held in the museum\u2019s collection at the time of proposed acquisition.",
    "gallery_text": "Carl Faberg\u00e9, through the eponymous jewelry firm his father began in 1840s St. Petersburg, helped to shift a Victorian interest in jewelry's large size and the inherent value of gemstones to an appreciation for subtle pieces with greater artistic value. After absorbing the world's arts in a European education that included stays in Paris, London, Italy, and Dresden, Faberg\u00e9 worked to revive ancient techniques and styles upon taking over the firm in 1870. By the 1890s, he was the leading Russian jeweler with the responsibility of crafting jewelry and objets d'art for the tsar, having gained the titles of Supplier to the Imperial Court and Appraiser to the Office of His Imperial Majesty. Late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Faberg\u00e9 pieces are renowned for their engine-turned enamel, or guilloch\u00e9, that enliven the surfaces. On this locket, the effect is that of creating a starburst that radiates from the central diamond. Faberg\u00e9, a skilled goldsmith, relied on workmasters to complete these highly technical pieces, but conceived or supervised work from his shop. August Hollming, whose mark appears on this locket, was a Finnish-born designer working in St. Petersburg who specialized in fine enamel gold boxes and jewelry.",
