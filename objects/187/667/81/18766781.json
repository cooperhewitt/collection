    "justification": "This drawing is by Adelgunde \u201cGunta\u201d St\u00f6lzl, the very significant and prolific German weaver who was instrumental in shifting the focus of the Bauhaus weaving workshops from pictorial works to industrial ready designs. Her textiles are renowned for their color, their abstract and asymmetrical composition, and their incorporation of new materials.\nThe drawing probably dates around 1927, the year that St\u00f6lzl started designing for a Jacquard loom. Two years earlier, when the Bauhaus was moving from Weimar to Dessau, the textiles workshop director, Georg Muche, bought six Jacquard looms much to St\u00f6lzl\u2019s dismay. St\u00f6lzl, then the textiles workshop master, believed that the handloom was better suited to the training of young weavers. St\u00f6lzl\u2019s experimentation with the loom, however, subsequently produced one of her great masterpieces 5 Ch\u00f6re (5 Choirs) in 1928. The proposed drawing would be a wonderful example to have in the collection because it is an early \u201cexperimental\u201d design for a Jacquard textile.\nSt\u00f6lzl studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich prior to entering the Bauhaus in 1919. At the Bauhaus, her courses with Paul Klee influenced her bright and lively color palette and the horizontally-aligned compositions used in her woven art of the 1920s and 30s. By 1925, she was appointed craft master of the weaving workshop and became the workshop master upon Muche\u2019s departure in 1927. Due to mounting political pressure, St\u00f6lzl was asked to step down in 1931. She moved to Zurich where she continued weaving, founding S P H Stoffe with fellow Bauhaus students Gertrude Preiswerk and Heinrich-Otto H\u00fcrlimann. After the departure of H\u00fcrlimann in 1937, she ran the workshop under the name Handweberei Flora (Flora Handweaving Mill). The company existed for 30 years, after which St\u00f6lzl continued weaving independently until her death. \nThis is a wonderful opportunity to acquire work by one of great female Bauhaus designers. This piece, together with another textile design drawing proposed for acquisition, would be the first examples of St\u00f6lzl\u2019s drawings in the museum\u2019s collection.",
