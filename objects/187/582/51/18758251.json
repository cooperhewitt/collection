In the film, women from the town of Stepford are replaced by beautiful but threatening cyborgs. The poster imitates the film\u2019s content; a woman appears to crumble, her delicate body depicted in jagged edges that resemble broken porcelain.",

Rather than depict an actual scene from the film, the designer chose to represent its inner psychology.",
