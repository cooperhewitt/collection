    "description": "Upper drawing:  Design for yellow diamond pave with small row of white diamond baguettes crafted out of yellow gold; design for brown diamond pave with small row of white diamond baguettes crafted out of white gold.  Middle drawing:  Design for yellow sapphire baguettes with small row of emeralds crafted out of white gold; design for emerald baguettes with small row of yellow saphires crafted in white gold.  Lower drawing: Design for emerald and yellow sapphire ovals surrounded by emerald and yellow sapphire baguettes crafted out of white gold.  These designs were not produced but the middle pair of designs inspired Stefan Hemmerle to create a similar bracelet made of citrine baguettes and 2 citrine cabochons crafted in rose gold and produced in 1997.",
    "justification": "In the late 1980s, Stefan Hemmerle created the first designs for the Harmony Bangle, a bracelet that has since become the signature of the Hemmerle firm. In the Harmony Bangle, the open-ended form, a style of bracelet that can be traced back to ancient times, is distinctly modern. Each end of the bracelet is capped in gems or stones while the rounded forms serve to extend the fluid lines of the bracelet. A hidden closure mechanism embedded within the bracelet enables the seamless form. The Harmony Bangle\u2019s simple, sophisticated silhouette has become the basis of decades of imaginative and seductive contrasts of materials. \nThis sketch, executed by Hemmerle in 1995, is a striking example of the designer working out the possibilities of the Harmony Bangle\u2019s fluid form when featuring pav\u00e9-set gemstones. The drawing depicts the early stages of working out an idea, and the immediacy of Hemmerle\u2019s creative process is on display in the faint, ballpoint pen sketches and the quickly rendered variations of the bracelet.\nThis drawing is one of four Hemmerle drawings under consideration for acquisition. Together, the group would enhance the museum\u2019s collection of jewelry design drawings.",
