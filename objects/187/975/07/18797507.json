    "description": "Drawing of ebony and dark snake wood bangle with gray navette diamond and brown navette diamond crafted out of plantimun and white gold.  Represents an early example of an innovative pivoting mechanism.  This bracelet was produced in 1996 on commission with one minor modification.  Instead of snake wood Padoukholz was used.",
    "justification": "In the late 1980s, Stefan Hemmerle created the first designs for the Harmony Bangle, a bracelet that has since become the signature of the Hemmerle firm. In the Harmony Bangle, the open-ended form, a style of bracelet that can be traced back to ancient times, is distinctly modern. Each end of the bracelet is capped in gems or stones while the rounded forms serve to extend the fluid lines of the bracelet. A hidden closure mechanism embedded within the bracelet enables the seamless form. The Harmony Bangle\u2019s simple, sophisticated silhouette has become the basis of decades of imaginative and seductive contrasts of materials. \nIn 1995, Stefan Hemmerle experienced the remarkable creative breakthrough that prompted him to begin pairing precious and semi-precious stones with surprising and provocative materials. This drawing, sketched in part by Hemmerle and completed by a member of his staff, illustrates one of the earliest examples of this irreverent but strikingly seductive combination. The bracelet\u2019s form is comprised of two contrasting woods, ebony and snakewood. Set on either end are brilliant diamonds of different colors. This Harmony Bangle was among the first to feature Hemmerle\u2019s innovative pivoting mechanism, further enhancing the seamless closure. Executed in ink wash, gouache, and watercolor, the drawing conveys the subtle differences in tone and texture that have become the distinctive signature of the Hemmerle firm.\nThis drawing is one of four Hemmerle drawings under consideration for acquisition. Together, the group would enhance the museum\u2019s collection of jewelry design drawings.",
