    "description":"Cushion of colored wools felted into a log form and then sliced, giving the effect of the rings of a tree. In shades of brown, purple, green and red, varying in composition from predominantly purple to predominantly red.",
    "justification":"The concept for The Slice (2003) was the culmination of twenty years of experimentation with felt. This piece is technically skillful, and it showcases the material qualities of felt: that it can be formed into three-dimensional objects, can be made dense enough to provide structure while maintaining a desirably soft surface hand, and visual patterning is accomplished in the same process that makes the material itself. The design is built up by layering fibers of varied colors, and the composition is rolled and felted with a remarkable degree of consistency through this now enormous roll of wool fiber. Once felted, the \u201clog\u201d is cut in slices, creating patterns resembling the annual rings of a tree trunk with each piece being unique and non-replicable. It is one material throughout, and one single process from raw material to finished, three-dimensional product, which is typically used as a seat cushion, but upends the notion of upholstery and filling, interior and surface. The Slice has won several awards including the Danish Craftsmanship Award in 2004, the Design+ Award in 2005 (Ambiente International Consumer Goods trade fair), and the German Design Award in 2006, and has been exhibited at the Netherlands Textile Museum, the Craft Museum of Finland, and other museums.
