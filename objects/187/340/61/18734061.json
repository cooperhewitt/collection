    "description":"Bookjacket design. Design on light brown ground. Cover features three abstracted depictions of human faces. At top left, face in a vaguely \u201chourglass\u201d shape with horizontal oval eyes, an attenuated nose with two circular nostrils, a brow made of a single thin line, and lips constructed from three semi-circles. A column of shaky horizontal black strokes covers left side of face, possibly meant to depict hair.\n At left center, face in shape of irregularly-shaped parallelogram. \u201cEyes\u201d made out of numerous intersecting lines, possibly meant to imply squinting or closed eyes. Below eyes, a long triangular nose and a mouth made of an s-curved mouth. Surrounding and covering lower portion of face are small, curved black strokes meant to resemble facial hair.\nAt bottom center, third face depicted in profile. Eye made of black dot inside three thin lines ending at point. Mouth made of two horizontal black lines. Face has black hair with jagged edges for bangs and bottom.",
