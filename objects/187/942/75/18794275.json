    "justification": "In his effort to make graphic design more human and personal in response to the \u201ccold\u201d modernist design of some colleagues, Stefan Sagmeister frequently uses himself as design inspiration. This was perhaps mostly famously executed in the 1999 AIGA poster advertising his lecture in Detroit, for which he carved the poster\u2019s text into his own skin. His self-promotional book, Things I Have Learned in My Life So Far, features his face on the cover and was inspired by a list of maxims in his personal diary with the same title. The book is comprised of 15 unbound brochures housed in a box, each documenting one of his personal truths and each illustrated with interactive installations from all over the world. The interactive nature of the installations is translated to the book format through the reader\u2019s ability to insert the individual booklets into the box to change the appearance of Sagmeister\u2019s face\u2014from sinister to appealing. The maxims include \u201cAssuming is stifling,\u201d \u201cEverybody thinks they are right,&quot; \u201cWorrying solves nothing,\u201d \u201cTrying to look good limits my life,\u201d \u201cKeeping a diary supports personal development,\u201d and \u201cOver time I get used to everything and start taking It for granted.\u201d \nSagmeister was born in Austria and studied graphic design at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and at the Pratt Institute in New York. After short apprenticeships with Leo Burnett\u2019s Hong Kong Design Group and at M &amp; Co., he opened his own firm in New York in 1993, Sagmeister Inc., which has since produced graphics, branding, and packaging for a variety of clients including Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the Guggenheim Museum, and Time Warner Inc. Sagmeister was appointed to the Frank Stanton Chair at the Cooper Union School of Art and teaches in the graduate department of the School of Visual Arts, both in New York City. He has received almost every significant international design award, including the 2005 National Design Award in the field of Communications Design and two Grammys\u2014one that same year for his packaging for the Talking Heads box set, Once in a Lifetime, and a second in 2010 for his packaging for the David Byrne and Brian Eno collaboration, Everything That Happens Will Happen Today. \nSagmeister\u2019s graphic production is original and challenges the limits of his profession. This publication, part of a larger group of objects by Sagmeister proposed for acquisition, will augment the museum\u2019s representation of work by this celebrated graphic designer.",
