    "description":"The Magdalen College dining hall is furnished with long tables, chairs and benches. One table is set for a meal with a white linen cloth, glasses and utensils. The Tudor style is reflected in the linen-fold panelled walls, carved with scenes from the life of St. Mary Magdalen; vaulted plaster ceiling; and leaded stained glass windows. Portraits of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and of the Magdalen College founder, William Waynflete, hang in their original positions, joined by portraits of others associated with the College.",
