A center table, covered with books, is also used for dining, as is evident in the damask crumb cloth spread over the floral-patterned carpet. On the left is a large window curtained in white; a sewing table holding a casual bouquet of flowers is placed in front. Furniture and ornament date to the early nineteenth century. A woman clothed head to toe in white stands to the right of the window.",
