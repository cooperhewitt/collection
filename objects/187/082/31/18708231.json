    "description":"A mixture of styles, typical of the Victorian period, is assembled in this beautifully painted interior of the Oak Parlour at Hall Place. The red and blue Persian carpet, sling chair with a Japanese motif,  two-sided sofa covered in a design after William Morris and Chinese porcelains all come together as furnishings for this neo-Elizabethan room; ferns and flowering plants complete this depiction of Victorian taste. On the left side of the room is a large organ with a figure in the act of playing seated at the keyboard.",
