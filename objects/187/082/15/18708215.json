    "description": "This view, dominated by horse paintings, indicates a room belonging to a sportsman or racing enthusiast. However, the use of matching blue-and-white upholstery fabric on the Rococo Revival furniture and in the window swags is not especially masculine. On the left, a trellis screen appears to enclose tall potted plants. Both the slant desk and flattop desk are inspirations of the Biedermeier period.",
