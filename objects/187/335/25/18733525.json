    "justification": "Apple\u2019s iPod and its variants are among the most influential personal appliances of the 21st century. This first generation iPod is a small, elegant form. The tactile appeal of the milky, translucent face is reinforced by simple shapes and contours inviting one to touch the controls\u2014the user interface is an innovative mechanical scroll wheel rather than traditional buttons. \nApple Computer, Inc., founded in 1976, by Stephen Wozniak and Steve Jobs, was well established as an innovator in the personal computer field by the time British designer, Jonathan Ive, joined the company in 1992. Ive rose to become the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design, and under his design direction in 1998\u201399, Apple introduced the iMac and iBook personal computer and laptop lines noted for their bulging, translucent, gumdrop colored housings. By 2001, the year the iPod was introduced as Apple\u2019s entry into the growing personal digital music player market, Ive\u2019s designs shifted to a more minimalist aesthetic. The sleek, smooth forms in titanium or aluminum used for Apple\u2019s powerful computer products were geared toward the business world, while glossy white casings were intended for the consumer market. The original iPod, with its iconic thin rectangular shape, white face, and chrome-colored back characterized this style.\nThe iPod technology and distinctive, universally recognizable design make this portable media player important in the continuum of industrial design, a major category for the museum\u2019s collection, a segment of which includes audio recording and playback devices.",
