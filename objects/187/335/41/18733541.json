    "description": "The view visitors would see as they exited the tram taking them from the parking garage to the hilltop where the main buildings are situated.  Figures stand in the arrival plaza at the foot of a cascading waterfall and staircases leading visitors to the museum entry building, on the upper left, and the restaurant pergola, at the upper right.",
    "justification": "Elevation of the Museum Entrance Area is one of a group of presentation drawings that Meier created to help Getty trustees envision his ideas for the complex. It presents the view visitors would see as they exited the tram from the parking garage to the hilltop where the main buildings are situated. Figures stand in the arrival plaza at the foot of a cascading waterfall and staircases leading to the museum entrance (upper left) and the restaurant pergola (upper right).\nAlthough the museum\u2019s collection includes prints by Meier, this drawing, together with another drawing proposed for acquisition, would be the first original drawings by Meier to enter the collection. As a pair, they make a great addition to the museum\u2019s collection of contemporary architectural drawings and prints.",
    "gallery_text": "The Getty Center in Los Angeles, arguably Richard Meier\u2019s most ambitious architectural project, comprises a group of buildings sited at the top of a hill, which the architect has likened to an Italian hilltown. By the time of this drawing, in 1991, Meier had been at work on the project for seven years, and construction was finally beginning\u2014alongside constant rethinking and redrawing of the designs and programmatic changes. The approach from the tram stop to the museum\u2019s main entrance was one such revision. Visitors would arrive via a tram that left from a parking garage below. This drawing, which the architect used to present his scheme to the museum\u2019s trustees, depicts the view visitors would see when first approaching the buildings from the tram. Meier has said that he sees more significance in the space buildings create than the buildings themselves, exemplified here by outlined, white-silhouetted figures seen walking together and gathering throughout the landscape. In 1997, after a dozen years of design and construction, the building opened to widespread acclaim by the architectural press.",
