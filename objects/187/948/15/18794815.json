    "description": "Flat, black, tapering rectangular form (a); top third of hard plastic with narrow metal touch control band in center; bottom two thirds of matte black pliable silicone encasing a jointed body that can be bent into a curved form. Separate small, black, rectangular, plastic and metal USB transceiver (b) on underside, attached via magnet.",
    "justification": "The mouse, a pointing device used to perform operations on the computer screen, has become as integral to computing as the keyboard. For years, the predominant mouse design has consisted of a unit held under the user\u2019s hand, with one or more buttons and a wheel to control the cursor and other screen elements. More recent designs utilize touch sensitive surfaces in place of mechanical buttons and wheels.\nPortability has become an increasingly desirable feature in personal computing, requiring devices and peripherals that provide reliability and convenience both in use or when packed away. Microsoft\u2019s wireless Arc Touch Mouse was designed with these user demands in mind. The lower portion of its body, comprised of over 90 parts, is jointed and flexible, which allows it to be stored flat for travel and then bent into a curve to fit the hand for use. The minimal, ergonomic design includes large flat buttons and a simple flat metal touch strip that mimics a scroll bar (a design feature that saves space by eliminating the scroll wheel). The jointed section is covered in a skin-like silicone sleeve, making it comfortable and easily gripped. \nThe Arc Touch Mouse is a product of Microsoft\u2019s in-house design studio, which creates the company's keyboards and mice. The designers built over 60 prototypes to find the form best suited for both the bent or flattened positions.  With energy conservation in mind, they also devised a way to preserve battery life\u2014 when in the flat travel position, the Arc Touch is off; it automatically turns on when curved for use.  The small transceiver that connects the wireless Arc Touch to a computer is magnetically held in place on the mouse\u2019s underside to prevent loss.\nSince its founding by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, Microsoft has been recognized as an innovator in the field of computer software and operating systems. More recently, it has also been recognized for its contributions to digital services and consumer electronics, of which the Arc Touch Mouse is a state-of-the-art example.",
