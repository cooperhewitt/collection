    "justification": "Hector Guimard is considered to be one of the most prominent innovators of the art nouveau style. Guimard is perhaps best known as the designer of the iconic Paris Metro station metalwork. He designed myriad decorative objects from ceramics to furniture fitting within the Gesamtkunstwerk of the art nouveau interior. He also was active in architectural design and his work included interiors, private residences, and commercial buildings. Guimard\u2019s building facades echoed their inventive interior spaces with curving, sinuous forms and architectural elements that fit within the vocabulary of art nouveau. One such decorative element Guimard designed for building exteriors were balcony grilles, like the one proposed for acquisition. \nThis design was used in multiple Guimard constructions, including an ensemble of buildings built between 1909 and 1911 (from which this example comes). The constructions include addresses in Paris at 17, 19, and 21 rue La Fontaine; the Tr\u00e9mois Building; H\u00f4tel Mezzara; and the Villa at Eaubonne. From private French residences to small pre-fabricated Parisian apartments, such cast iron works were incorporated throughout several exterior schemes, emphasizing the variability of cast iron, both as a decorative material and early example of mass production. During the 1960s, tenants in Guimard-designed buildings were allowed to change and remove the architectural metalwork, such as these balcony grilles, leading to the dissemination of some of the examples. Those that remained can no longer be removed.\nThe manufacturer responsible for producing Guimard\u2019s architectural metalwork was the Saint-Dizier foundry. These grilles serve as an excellent example of a design and industry collaboration resulting in the dissemination of a style that has left a unique mark on the history of design, and has played an important role in early 20th-century visual culture. After Guimard\u2019s death in 1942 in New York, his widow, Madame Guimard, gave several gifts of her late husband's work to the museum. The objects are from the first decade of the 20th century and include a chair, vases, frames, and a door bell pull. This acquisition will add a new dimension to the museum\u2019s Guimard holdings, as it will be the first exterior architectural design work by Guimard in the collection.",

Sinuous, organic lines generate aesthetic continuity between the balconies and the interiors, which were also designed by Guimard.",
