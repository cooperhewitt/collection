    "gallery_text": "Sheila Hicks is one of the most important textile artists of the 20th century. Papillon (1997-2004), measuring only 10 13\/16\u201d x 7 1\/16\u201d is one of almost 1,000 works included in her series Miniatures \u2013 an enduring project that began over 50 years ago. Each was created on a small loom constructed from painter\u2019s stretcher bars, which made a practical and portable companion throughout her travels in India, Mexico, France, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. \nAptly named Papillon, which translates to \u201cbutterfly\u201d in French, the textile is reminiscent of delicate butterfly wings. Hicks uses bookbinder\u2019s paste to stiffen tripled floating warps of earthy colors like brown, orange and yellow. Thin sheets of dye transfer paper in chartreuse and ochre hues are artfully crushed and woven between the warps. They are secured in place with small running stitches, revealing the textile\u2019s construction. Inspired by perhaps one of the most beautiful and elusive creatures in the natural world \u00ad\u2013 the ephemeral butterfly \u2013 Hicks endeavors to explore both the capabilities and characteristics of materials, color, form and technique.",
