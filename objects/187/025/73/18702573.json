    "description": "A large tree grows up the right side of the design with a large bird perched on a branch.  A cobweb suspends from its branches. Outgrowth of small flowers at treetop. A second bird sits at the base of the tree while a butterfly is in flight. Printed in a pale yellow and mauve on a white ground.",
    "justification": "Cobwebs was designed and printed by Marthe Armitage of Chiswick, England. The paper is graphically strong but is printed in muted colors, Armitage\u2019s preferred color palette. The paper was printed by linoleum block on a manual offset lithographic printing press.\nArmitage attended the Chelsea School of Art in the 1940s and was Master of the Art Workers\u2019 Guild in 1993. The Art Workers\u2019 Guild is a society of artists, craftsmen and designers founded in the 1890s, whose past Masters have included Walter Crane, William Morris, and C. F. A. Voysey. She was inspired by William Morris, A. W. N. Pugin, and Edward Bawden. The flatness of her designs is especially reminiscent of Pugin and Bawden. \nGreat Britain is a leader in the innovative design of contemporary wallcoverings and it is important to represent this body of work in our collection. We have a growing collection of papers by contemporary British designers and this piece would help to better fully represent the variety of work being done.",
