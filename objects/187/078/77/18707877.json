She is best known for her bold geometric designs of the 1960s and 1970s, most created for Heal Fabrics, an important producer of avant-garde designs. Brown\u2019s distinctive style pioneered the fashion for bold geometric patterns on an architectural scale, including three-dimensional and op art effects. The textile proposed for acquisition, Spiral, won the United Kingdom\u2019s Council of Industrial Design Award in 1970.",
    "gallery_text": "In the 1960s, Heal Fabrics was London\u2019s most avant-garde textile producer, and Barbara Brown was their most prominent designer. Trained at the Canterbury College of Art and the Royal College of Art, she began designing for Heal in 1958 and continued into the early 1970s. Brown\u2019s distinctive style pioneered the fashion for bold geometric patterns on an architectural scale. In the mid-1960s she began exploring trompe l\u2019oeil and Op Art effects, playing increasingly with illusions of depth. Spiral was one of a series of large-scale, mechanistic designs which in which she mastered her characteristic three-dimensional effects. Using nothing but simple, graphic, black and white lines, she creates a spiraling column of striking dimensionality. It won the United Kingdom\u2019s Council of Industrial Design Award in 1970.",
