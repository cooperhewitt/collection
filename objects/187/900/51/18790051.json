    "justification":"In an attempt to help complete his idea of an American life-style, Wright also designed textiles. The tablecloth represents one of his patterns, Modern Spice, which was produced by Simtex. It was included in Better Homes and Garden in May 1951, and the advertisement offers it in two colorways: Paprika and Curry, which seen here. It was also manufactured in two sizes: 52 x 52 and 52 x 70. The ad also refers to Wright\u2019s and Simtex\u2019s \u201cGood Design\u201d distinction, bestowed upon them by the Museum of Modern Art as part of their Good Design series.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nModern Spice is a fairly intricate pattern where four bands of color intersect to create a total of ten different tones, including four main colors plus the six blended combinations. This beautiful overlay of color on top of color, recalls works by Anni Albers, such as her 1930 tablecloth design and textile. Within the complexity of Wright\u2019s and Albers\u2019s patterns is a simplicity of overall effect that befit the modern interior in 1930s Germany and 1950s America and makes them timeless even today.&amp;nbsp; ",
