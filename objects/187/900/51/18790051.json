    "justification": "Russel Wright was one of the most important pioneers in American design, especially recognized for his efforts to revolutionize how people live and relate to their domestic environment. As Donald Albrecht wrote in the catalog for the museum\u2019s 2001\u20132 exhibition, Russel Wright: Creating American Lifestyle, Wright\u2019s \u201cinexpensive, mass produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances, and textiles were not only visually and technically innovative but were also the tools to achieve his concept of \u2018easier living,\u2019 a unique American lifestyle that was gracious yet contemporary and informal.\u201d \nTo help complete his idea of an American lifestyle, Wright also designed textiles. This tablecloth represents one of his patterns, Modern Spice, which was produced by Simtex. Modern Spice was manufactured in two sizes: 52 by by 52 inches and 52 by 70 inches. It was included in Better Homes and Gardens in May 1951; the advertisement offers it in two colorways: Paprika and Curry\u2014the Curry colorway is the textile under consideration. The ad also acknowledges Wright\u2019s and Simtex\u2019s \u201cGood Design\u201d distinction, bestowed upon them by MoMA as part of its Good Design exhibition series. &amp;nbsp;Modern Spice is a fairly intricate pattern in which four bands of color intersect to create a total of 10 different tones (four main colors plus the six blended combinations). This beautiful overlay of color on top of color is complex, but retains a simplicity of overall effect that suited the modern interior of 1950s America and appears timeless even today. \nThis would be the first example of a textile by Wright in the museum\u2019s collection and would join over 100 works in the collection by Wright\u2014from a design drawing for flatware to extensive examples from his American Modern line of tableware and serving accessories.
