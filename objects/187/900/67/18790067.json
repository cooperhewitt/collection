    "justification": "This textile by Frank, Bows, was produced in 1960 after an early design for a carpet for Haus &amp; Garten from 1929. Unlike his designs for printed fabrics, which were entirely inspired by nature, Frank\u2019s carpet designs were based on paving patterns and other abstract geometrics. The design itself is in the Backhausen archives in Vienna, and the carpet, produced by Almadahl\u2019s, was featured in an interior in Innen-Dekoration in 1933. Thirty years after the original design, this fabric still feels fresh and modern, with its field of large, activated geometric pattern of imbricated semi-circles, circles, wedges, diamonds, rectangles and squares, printed in brilliant navy and pale blue, green, yellow, burnt orange, lilac, and tan on a white linen and cotton ground.",
