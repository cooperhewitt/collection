    "justification": "With the creation of Eclat, a vibrant screenprinted textile for drapery and upholstery, weaver and artist Anni Albers delved into the art of screenprinting. This was a new textile-making direction for the designer, brought about by her experimentation with lithography in the mid-1960s. At that time, her husband was asked to work at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, where the head of the workshop, June Wayne, encouraged her to try lithography. Albers experienced a newfound expressive quality in the medium and, by the 1970s, printmaking had become her primary focus. This knowledge of printmaking, as well as her passion for the techniques, no doubt impacted her subsequent textiles designs. Like other well-known works by Albers, the surface of this textile is animated by parallelograms that together create a dynamic three-dimensional effect. Eclat was intended as both a drapery fabric and for light upholstery applications, and was first available in a dozen colorways\u2014this particular version is executed primarily in a persimmon color.\nIn 1957, Albers began her association with Knoll Textiles as a consultant on a line of new textiles, including a series of casement fabrics. These fabrics were quite typical of Albers\u2019s work during her years as both a student and teacher at the Bauhaus and later in the United States, where she and her husband, Josef Albers, emigrated in 1933 to teach at Black Mountain College (1933\u201349). The design of these casement fabrics recalls her entirely functional approach to textiles with an ongoing curiosity about and experimentation with new fibers and techniques.",
    "gallery_text": "Anni Albers is best known for her woven art, produced over a weaving career of almost fifty years. After accompanying her husband Josef to a lithography workshop in 1963, she began working in graphic arts. She gave up weaving entirely in 1970 to focus her creative energy on printmaking. This printed Knoll fabric is based on her screenprint and photo-offset work, PO II (1973).\nThe pattern evidences Albers\u2019 mastery of the language of modular, geometric forms. Both her woven and printed work were animated by what she called \u201ca concern for order in a not too obvious way, an order puzzling to the onlooker, so that he will return again and again.\u201d Here, isosceles trapezoids and parallelograms are carefully arranged according to subtle principles of repetition and rotation into elegantly interlocking groups. No two groupings within the fabric\u2019s repeat are exactly the same, and the boundaries of the groups are deliberately ambiguous.",
