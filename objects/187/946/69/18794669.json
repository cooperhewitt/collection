    "description":"A dressing room interior whose walls and tented ceiling are covered in a delicate vine trellis-patterned textile. On dressing table at rear center, a porcelain pitcher and basin sit in front of a silver mirror in rococo-revival style, flanked by candelabra.  Pitchers and basins, possibly of Vincennes manufacture, on top of wash stand at right.  A table covered with lace cloth at left, holds toilet accessories; brushes, mirrors, pots, and covered jars.  A formal portrait on left wall might well be the owner of this opulent room.  Dried flowers encased in glass domes on either side of portrait.  A carpet divided into horizontal and octagonal fields holding neoclassical and neo-gothic motifs covers floor.",
