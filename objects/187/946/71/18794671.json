    "description":"Octagonal room of stone or painted stone with arched openings on four sides and a cupula of Moorish-inspired interlace.  The central rear arch leads to a receding colonnade while lateral niches display two large neoclassical urns with painted Moorish decoration.  Below the side niches are European versions of Turkish ottomans covered with French mid-century textiles.  A large pipe stand of Germanic origin occupies the center of the kiosk and an octagonal table sits to the right.  Barely noticeable amidst the room's richly patterned surfaces is a man reclining on a central ottoman smoking a hooka, attended by a male servant to his left.",
