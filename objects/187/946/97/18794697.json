    "justification": "Tissu simultan\u00e9 no. 46 was designed in 1924 and represents a particularly important period in Sonia Delaunay\u2019s textile design. After experiencing success with costume and fashion presentations for an avant-garde circle of painters and poets, Delaunay began thinking of more commercial options for her textiles. By 1923 she was designing printed fabrics called tissus simultan\u00e9, which she used in her fashion and accessories and sold to firms in France and abroad.\nTissu simultan\u00e9 no. 46, a bold geometric design of blue, yellow, and black lines on a white ground, has the hallmark characteristics of her textiles from the 1920s: contrasting colors with abstract, geometric, or rounded patterns that are block-printed on cotton or silk fabric. In fact, she often printed the same pattern and colorway on different types of fabrics to achieve very different effects. Although this same pattern has been printed on other textiles, such as cotton, that absorb more of the color, this example is silk and the color sits on the surface for a more vibrant and painterly effect. Delaunay made a distinction between her paintings and textiles, but tried to capture the immediacy of the creative process in both. In the early 1920s, she initially carved her own wood blocks in order to reveal particular subtleties. Only later, when she became too busy to carve the blocks herself, did she instead supervise the process. Although Delaunay ultimately returned to painting after the 1930s, she always saw textiles and painting as equals.\nDelaunay was a modern artist and designer who merged art and everyday life. Her work encompassed everything from paintings, drawings, painted ceramics, and neon light sculpture to posters, textiles, and costume design. Born in 1885 as Sarah Stern to a Jewish laborer\u2019s family in Gradizhsk, Ukraine, she was adopted at the age of five by her maternal uncle, Henri Terk, a wealthy lawyer in St. Petersburg. Showing artistic talent in her youth, she attended an art academy in Germany and later went to Paris where she met her husband, Robert Delaunay, also a painter. Together they developed the theory of simultaneity\u2014the sensation of movement when placing contrasting colors side by side. This is expressed in their paintings as well as in the Sonia Delaunay\u2019s textiles from the 1920s. \nThis would be the first textile by Sonia Delaunay to enter the collection. It is extremely rare to find Delaunay textiles, since most of her textiles were not signed and are therefore difficult to identify. This textile has the inscription \u201cTissus Simultan\u00e9,\u201d which immediately identifies it as designed by Delaunay.",
