    "justification":"Seismic (angular) was designed and produced by TAR in response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. It was made using a notched rubber blade to hand-pull the narrow stripes of deep blue across the bright blue cotton chintz ground. Working in tandem across the printing table, Rauscher and Tillett manually jerk the blade at regular intervals, creating a fabric with an architectonic feeling, and giving the illusion of three-dimensional vertical columns.
