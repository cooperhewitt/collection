    "description": "Polka-dot design with a vertical orientation. Printed in shades of green on a white ground, the size of the dots varies, and each has the appearance of being \"dropped\" onto the page.",
    "justification": "This design is from the Ink Collection, the second collection by graphic designer J. Abbott Miller for Knoll Textiles. Based on Miller\u2019s experiments with the liquid movement of ink and how ink reacts as it moves across the surface of paper, each design appears to be random while simultaneously retaining a sense of control. Drop forms a loosely organized polka-dot design with a definite vertical orientation composed of varying sized dots. Each dot appears to have been dropped onto the paper\u2019s surface, where the ink then proceeded to splatter or run.\nKnoll Textiles has consistently produced a number of wallcoverings suitable for both residential and commercial interiors that break from the traditional neutral wallcovering. The Ink Collection is part of this group, with brightly colored bold designs that create energy in a room, rather than merely forming a background. Drop possesses a lighthearted, spontaneous feel, making it appropriate for use in a variety of interior settings from children\u2019s rooms to meeting rooms.\nThe Ink Collection wallcoverings are eco-friendly as they are printed on Recore, a vinyl wallcovering composed of 30% recycled content that is Greenguard certified for low chemical emissions. The non-woven backing is made from recycled polyester.",
