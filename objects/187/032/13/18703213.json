There is a bright pink bird on a branch with a column of light blue bands on the right.  There is lettering in light blue at the upper right spelling \"STU\" above \"VZN.\"  There are white embroidered flowers around the bottom and a gray and yellow flower on the back.",
    "justification": "In 2004, Cooper-Hewitt commissioned Dutch designer Hella Jongerius to create a series of 10 textiles (2005-33-1\/10), collectively titled Sampler Blanket. This work was undertaken in conjunction with the 2005 exhibition, Hella Jongerius Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection.\nEach work in this series is inspired by designs found on historic samplers in the museum\u2019s Textiles department. Embroidered samplers are one of the richest areas of the collection: the department has over 1,000 examples from all over the world. Jongerius visited the collection three times between 2003 and 2004 and viewed hundreds of samplers. Jongerius was interested in the learning process inherent in the making of these objects, the historic use and reuse of established motifs, and the highly personal symbols and information contained within samplers. \nTo create Sampler Blanket, the motifs are hand-cut from recycled materials and joined to the foundation fabric using needle-punch technology, in which mechanized needle boards holding hundreds of barbed needles push up and down through the layers to entangle the fibers together. As a result, a second \u201cshadow\u201d version of the imagery appears on the back. These are then embellished with machine embroidery. Inspired by traditional handwork but using industrial processes and recycled materials, Sampler Blanket explores the transition between domestic and industrial production, and the influence of the hand even within technological innovation.",
