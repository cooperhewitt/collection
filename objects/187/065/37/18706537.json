    "justification": "This French art deco paper is boldly designed, brightly colored, and representative of the period. While beautifully-styled, it does not have a printed ground color. Ungrounded papers were less costly and were printed on a paper stock that is lighter in weight than their grounded peers. Some ungrounded papers were printed to hide the fact there was no ground; for others, the visible paper support was worked into the overall pattern.\nThis paper is part of a larger group of rolls of papers under consideration for acquisition that would be a wonderful addition to the collection in both style and size. In 2001, we acquired a group of French art deco wallpaper sample book pages (ca. 1930) produced by the Isidore Leroy Company. Good examples of art deco papers are an area of top collection priority.",
