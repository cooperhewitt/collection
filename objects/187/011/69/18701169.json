    "justification":"This textile by Jongstra is a primary example of felting, which is a technique that uses the application of pressure, heat, and moisture to mat together fibers. Oftentimes the fibers are not spun or twisted, but are simply a mass of fibers lying indiscriminately in all directions. Two fabrics in particular by Jongstra, Composition (SI 001) (2005-3-2), seen here, and Composition (DH\/WD\/SI 001) (2005-3-1), were commissioned specifically for the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt. They exemplify not only the general range of felting techniques, but also the variety of Jongstra\u2019s work.&amp;nbsp;The refined and rippled fabric of this textile, Composition (SI 001), is made of wool merino, wild silk and cotton gauze, and reveals to the viewer the finesse of her craft, as opposed to the other example which looks as though it came straight of the back of the sheep.
