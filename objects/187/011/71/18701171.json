    "description": "Bioimplantable device for reconstructive shoulder surgery in the form of a snowflake, with eight short and eight long projections from a center ring, machine embroidered in white and blue polyester with the base cloth dissolved for a lace-like effect.",
    "justification": "This embroidered medical device is an unconventional collaboration between physicians and embroidery designers, combining textile engineering with the life sciences. The technique of machine embroidery on dissolvable substrate, long used to produce machine-made lace, is employed here to embroider surgical devices from suture thread. The CAD program used to create new embroidery designs is used in conjunction with advanced medical imaging technologies to generate customized implants that mimic natural fibrous arrays, such as ligaments. The device is manufactured in the form of a snowflake, with eight short and eight long projections from a center ring, machine embroidered in white and blue polyester with the base cloth dissolved for a lace-like effect. The embroidery technique allows the creation of \u201cstructurally biocompatible\u201d devices with integrated eyelets for the insertion of screws and an open lace-like structure that promotes tissue in-growth.\nThe device was developed by Ellis Developments Ltd., manufactured by Pearsalls Ltd., designed by Prof. Simon Frostick, Dr. Lars Neumann, Prof. W. Angus Wallace, and Dr. Alan McLeod between 1997 and 2003; the textile was designed by Peter Butcher in 2004. \nCooper-Hewitt\u2019s collection contains historic and contemporary examples of this technique (machine embroidery on dissolvable substrate) used for decorative purposes. This would be the first technical use of the technique to be accessioned into the collection, and may be the first technical use yet devised.",
    "gallery_text": "This surgical implant, developed after a close collaboration between physicians and textile engineers, was designed for a patient who had a tumor removed from his shoulder and needed extensive reconstruction two years later. The surgeon had requested a wide range of possible attachment points so he could use all of the tissue he found in the patient at implantation. This design, made using advanced medical imaging technologies and a computer-aided design (CAD) program, uses machine embroidery to create a scaffold or structure to which the surgeon can attach the metal replacement bone and healthy tissue. Embroidery allows elements such as eyelets to be integrated into the design to accommodate attachment points and to create open areas for tissue ingrowth. Embroidery can mimic the natural fibrous arrays of ligaments and form a scaffold for new growth. It can also be cut without fraying. From a machine that can produce elaborate decorative trimmings has emerged a more vital and utilitarian product of astonishing strength, delicacy, and beauty.",
    "label_text": "This customized surgical implant represents a collaboration between physicians and textile engineers. The embroidery, of polyester suture thread, mimics the natural fibrous arrays of ligaments. The lacy structure that remains when the base cloth dissolves acts as a scaffold for new tissue growth.",
