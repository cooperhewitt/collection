    "provenance": "Sony President, Akio Morita owned and kept this television in his New York office (having brought the television from Japan when he moved to New York in 1962), then gave it to Hiroko Onoyama, his administrative assistant, at the time of his retirement (1994). Ms. Onoyama donated the television to Cooper-Hewitt in 2011, on her retirement from Sony.",

    "justification": "Sony began in Tokyo in 1945 as a radio-repair shop. In the 1950s, it developed a reputation for transistor technology, which it used in portable radios. In 1959, the company adapted that technology to the television set and the resulting product was the TV-8-301. Launched in May 1960\u2014the same year Sony Corporation of America was established\u2014it caused a monumental shift in Sony\u2019s product line, and was a game-changer for both the company and the industry.\nThe TV-8-301 marks many important moments in television history. It was the world\u2019s first fully transistorized television set. It was also the first direct-view transistor TV and the first Japanese TV to be sold in the United States. The set reflects the state-of-the-art technology of its day, when the transistor was used instead of a vacuum tube, allowing the object to be small and portable rather than the furniture-like designs of previous television sets. For example, in contrast to Philco's Safari portable TV, which had a vertical picture tube and depended on angled mirrors that reflected the image on a narrow field of vision, Sony\u2019s picture tube was mounted horizontally, allowing the picture to be viewed from all angles. Its curved shape is derived directly from the tube; the designers removed excess material to minimize the object\u2019s size. The set also introduced the now-famous style of a centralized SONY logo.\nSony\u2019s co-founder, Akio Morita (who owned this exact example of the TV-8-301), famously did not believe in market research for new products. He believed Sony was the expert at devising new products and introducing them to consumers. The TV-8-301 stands as a testament to this idea. Marketing experts in the United States did not think that small, portable television sets would sell\u2014they believed the public wanted larger sets. Yet the TV-8-301 launched Sony\u2019s TV business. Two years later, the TV5-303, an even smaller model, became a huge hit in the US.\nThe acquisition of this early portable TV would be an asset to the museum\u2019s collection. At the time of proposed acquisition, the collection includes three other televisions from this period: a Braun TV (1958), a Philco Predicta set (1959), and a Wegavision 3000 (ca. 1960). The TV-8-301 would serve as a counterpart to these larger examples, and would also demonstrate the goal of the time to minimize the size of appliances. The museum would like to enhance its collection of important mid-century electronics, as they represent a significant segment of the growing consumerism and changing lifestyles of Americans in the postwar decades.",
