    "description": "Modular open-work tile structure made of recycled plastic and coated with titanium dioxide. Designed as a functional facade element to reduce air pollution.",
    "justification": "Why Design Now? was the fourth installment in the National Design Triennial series and reflected the global connectedness of design practices and design\u2019s ability to address environmental and social challenges. The projects selected were organized around eight central themes of innovative contemporary design: energy, mobility, community, materials, prosperity, health, communication, and simplicity. The exhibition showcased progressive design that proposed new methodologies. An installation of ProSolve 370e modular tiles was among the projects displayed. The tiles offer a practical design solution for environmental needs and exemplify an idea that would inspire further research and show the transformative power of design in the 21st century. \nProSolve 370e, designed by principals Allison Dring and Daniel Schwaag of the design firm Elegant Embellishments, is a modular tile structure designed to reduce air pollution in the surrounding environment. The recycled plastic tiles are coated with titanium dioxide to neutralize nitrogen oxide. Nitrogen oxide is harmful to the respiratory system, depletes the ozone layer, and contributes to acid rain. The designers utilized rapid prototyping techniques and computer-generated forms to maximize the antimicrobial, self-cleaning, and air-purifying qualities of titanium dioxide. Prosolve 370e can be installed as a functional facade element to redesign buildings and parking garages for our future environment with a sustainable new material.\nThe selected ProSolve tiles from the Triennial exhibition would add to the museum\u2019s examples of design for dividing and defining space. At the time of proposed acquisition, these include an Eames wood folding screen, 1960s Sculpta Grille panels, and the Algue screen by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec.",
