    "description": "Irregular pattern of dark blue cloud-like shapes on three off-white panels that are stitched together.",
    "justification": "In regard to Space Panel No. 5, the designer Hiroyuki Shindo explains the shibori process with the word okkochi which means \u201cthe eastern wind\u201d, and when spoken also suggests \u201cto let fall.\u201d It describes a kind of dyeing technique developed in Arimatsu about 300 years ago during the Edo period. The story of the origin of shibori claims that a wind from the east blew just a corner of kimono fabric into a vat of indigo.&amp;nbsp; From this incident, a new kind of shaped dyeing was born that was less methodical than traditional shibori tie-dye resist and more reflective of the patterns of nature. In Shindo\u2019s okkochi interpretation, he makes a wooden trough about four centimeters deep and scatters small stones and pebbles on the bottom and at the edges.&amp;nbsp; Laying the cloth in this shallow trough he carefully pushes it into the concave shapes in-between the stones.&amp;nbsp;Dye is ladled many times into the depressions of the fabric, and he constantly changes the boundary of the well and the depth of the stones to make gradations of color. This work by Shindo is an excellent representation of printed and dyed contemporary Japanese textiles. \nAdditionally, Shindo's shibori dye production technique follows that of&amp;nbsp;traditional techniques.&amp;nbsp;In his workshop cermamic dye pots are sunk into the earthen floor and dried indigo leaves are combined with lye, lime, wheat bran, sake, and a microorganism. The fermentation of this mixture takes seven to ten days, and the indigo dyestuff must be stirred regularly. The pots are heated with charcoal to maintain a temperature of twenty degrees centigrade. After the indigo is ready, Shindo begins the dyeing process and with indigo, the full intensity of the color is achieved by repeated dipping and subsequent oxidization rather than how long the fabric is submerged in the dye.&amp;nbsp; ",
