    "justification": "Stitched Puzzle, designed by David Rockwell for the Maya Romanoff Corporation, offers a glimpse into the range of colors and textures Rockwell employs to create his interiors. While Rockwell has designed everything from stage sets and hotels to playgrounds and home furnishings, Stitched Puzzle is from the designer\u2019s first collection of wallcoverings. Initially inspired by a Maya Romanoff design titled Weathered Walls (ca. 1900), the Stitched collection is given a very updated and handcrafted look by the addition of stitching.\nThe architecture and design practice he founded in 1984, Rockwell Group, has received numerous design awards, including the 2008 National Design Award in the field of Interior Design and the 2001 Presidential Award for the Grand Central Terminal restoration and renovation. One of the hallmarks of Rockwell interiors is the unexpected mix of textures, patterns, and materials used to create an environment or evoke an emotional response.\nMaya Romanoff has been creating innovative wallcoverings since 1969. Rockwell\u2019s point of inspiration the Stitched collection, Weathered Walls, is among the Maya Romanoff wallcoverings in the museum\u2019s collection. The proposed acquisition of papers from Rockwell\u2019s Stitched collection would allow us to document the Maya Romanoff firm\u2019s changing production as well as their collaboration with today\u2019s leading design talents.",
