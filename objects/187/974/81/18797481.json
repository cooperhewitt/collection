    "justification": "Lockwood de Forest\u2019s family was distantly related to Frederic Edwin Church\u2019s family, and the two knew each other socially. In 1868, de Forest and his parents traveled with the Church family to Greece and Egypt. During their travels, de Forest painted side by side with Church, and Church inspired the young man to take up landscape painting as a profession\u2014de Forest abandoned college and the law and turned to painting as a full-time career. He studied with Church in the early 1870s, painting oil sketches of the area around Hudson, New York, and also painting after Church\u2019s sketches of the Holy Land and Petra, Egypt. During this period, Church also designed and built his new Near Eastern-inspired home, which encouraged de Forest to interpret Islamic designs for American interiors. \nIn 1876, de Forest traveled again with his parents to Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, with the goal of visiting all the locations that Church had visited and painted. The results of de Forest\u2019s study of Church\u2019s works can be seen in the earliest of the sketches depicting the Jordan River, near Jericho at Wadi Qelt, dated March 20, 1876. If one were to put this sketch next to Church\u2019s, one would see a similar treatment of the desert brush, with tall shoots picked out by the light, as well as a similar perspective of the bare mountain. The painting shows a sure and relatively tight hand, close to Church\u2019s example.",
