    "justification": "The lusterware ceramics produced by Zsolnay of P\u00e9cs, Hungary, represent some of the most innovative forms and glazing technology of the late 19th and early 20th century. The Zsolnay firm was founded in 1853 by Mikl\u00f3s Zsolnay whose son, Vilmos, took over the company's leadership in 1865. It was under Vilmos that Zsolnay began to transform both the design and technology of its ceramic wares. Combining local tradition with close attention to stylistic developments in England and France, Zsolnay's production was unique to the period. \nZsolnay's experimentation included reinterpretation of historical forms, including those with references to the Far Eastern origins of lusterware. It was Zsolnay's use of eosin-reduced glazing to create freeform, non-figural color patterns on sinuous ceramic bodies that made the company's production so popular at the turn of the 20th-century.",
