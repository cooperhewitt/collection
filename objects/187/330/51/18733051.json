    "justification": "The iPhone is an innovative design by Apple Computer, Inc., and one of the most influential communications devices in the \"smartphone\u201d category.\nResponding to the burgeoning market for smartphones and building on its iPod series, Apple began developing the iPhone when then CEO, Steve Jobs, asked the company\u2019s engineers to investigate touch screens\u2014nearly three years before the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut. Although the firm collaborated with Cingular Wireless (now AT&T), Apple developed the iPhone\u2019s innovative hardware and software in-house. Jobs unveiled the product in January 2007 for a June launch. The iPhone was hotly anticipated, with thousands of people lining up at Apple Stores throughout the United States hours before they went on sale. The iPhone\u2019s extensive functionality, sleek appearance, and ease of use instantly attracted consumers of all ages.\nThe iPhone is a monolithic slab that is light and comfortable in the hand. The iPhone\u2019s face is almost entirely covered with a glass screen that displays easy-to-read brightly-colored applications and graphics. Among the most significant iPhone innovations is a touch-sensitive surface activated by a bare finger\u2014previous touch screens had required a stylus. The sophisticated screen responds to a variety of touch gestures, enabling content access with tapping, pinching, dragging, or sliding motions. The display also responds to three sensors, allowing it to dim when not near the face or hand, and enabling it to shift from portrait to landscape mode depending on the orientation of the phone.\nThe iPhone would be the first smartphone in the museum\u2019s collection. Other mobile devices held by the museum at the time of proposed acquisition include the IBM Simon (1993), a car phone by the German manufacturer AEG (1994), and Motorola\u2019s StarTAC \u201cclamshell\u201d phone (1999).",
    "gallery_text": "The iPhone is the multipurpose tool for the digital age. Mobile phone, computer, and high-resolution photograph and video camera are just a few of its many functions. The colorful, easy-to-read, and visually pleasing graphics and easy-to-use applications appeal to a wide variety of consumers. Among the most significant iPhone innovations is a touch-sensitive surface, activated by a bare finger that further streamlines the instrument\u2019s use. \nLike its distant ancestor the hand axe, the iPhone fits neatly in the hand, is comfortable to operate and multitasks without changing size or shape.",
    "label_text": "The multitasking tool of the digital age, the iPhone has a light, well-balanced rectangular form that fits neatly in the hand. No tool has fulfilled as many functions or been accessible to such a range of users. Operated by simple finger gestures\u2014swipe, pinch, drag\u2014the iPhone transforms itself, without changing shape, into hundreds of different tools: a camera, flashlight, GPS device, book . . .",
