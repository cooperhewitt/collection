    "justification": "Brooklyn-based Ben Mickus has kept the environment high on his agenda while creating thoughtful furniture designs. Mickus \u201ctypifies the up-and-coming generation of intelligent green designers who view their design and environmental responsibilities to be as natural as breathing.\u201d[1]\nThe Relief chair is part of the Solid\/Surface\/Series collection, which includes several other pieces of furniture that experiment with combining an ancient material, felt, with modern technology. The chair's name reflects both the physical relief the user is meant to feel when sitting down and the appearance of a three-dimensional topographical plan. The composition juxtaposes weight and weightlessness in the combination of layered felt on stainless steel legs. The designer \u201c[searches] for raw, industrial materials that can be transformed into evocative yet functional objects.\u201d[2]\nMickus uses cutting and lamination to create his designs. Sheets of medium-density industrial wool felt, a renewable material, are water-jet cut to specific outlines, stacked, arranged to create a solid form, and laminated with a non-toxic, water-based glue to the stainless steel frame. \nThe very act of creating the actual seat from felt, rather than using petroleum-based foam- and fume-generating upholstery is also an environmental statement. According to Mickus, \u201cthese projects are also a study of what I can eliminate and replace with a design that uses one material\u2014in this case, felt\u2014for cushion, surface and pattern.\u201d[3] Another Mickus design, Refill Pillow (a modular acoustic absorption system), uses leftover scraps&amp;nbsp; from the Relief Chair as pellet fill\u2014yet another considered step in his environmentally-conscious design process. \nThis proposed acquisition would support the museum\u2019s commitment to environmentally sensitive and sustainable design.\n[1] Huang Nickmatui, \u201cGeneration Green,\u201d Home Concepts, May 2009.[2] Jake Townsend, \u201c\u2019Fashioning Felt\u2019: Furniture designers get crafty,\u201d Los Angeles Times, March 11, 2009, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/home\/la-hm-scoutfelt10-story.html\">http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/home\/la-hm-scoutfelt10-story.html<\/a>[3] Townsend, \u201c\u2019Fashioning Felt.\u2019\u201d",
