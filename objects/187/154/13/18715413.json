    "justification":"In 2004, the Museum commissioned Hella Jongerius to create a series of ten textiles, collectively titled Sampler Blanket (2005-33-1 through 2005-33-10), in conjunction with an exhibition of her works. Each work in the show was inspired by designs found on historic samplers in the Museum\u2019s Textile collection, which&amp;nbsp;includes over 1,000 examples of embroidered samplers from all over the world spanning three centuries. Shortly thereafter, Maharam, a fourth generation family textile company, became interested in collaborating with Jongerius to make a production version inspired by the Sampler Blanket collection, and as a result, they introduced Layers Garden Double and Layers Park Double. These textiles were designed by Jongerius and manufactured by Maharam, each&amp;nbsp;in three color ways. This version, Layers Garden Double, is a dark green wool fabric that has been appliqu\u00e9d with a dark brown layer, which is then partially cut away by hand, and then red stitching joins the fabric and creates the embroidered pattern on the textile. This three dimensional floral textile is primarily used for upholstery.\n&amp;nbsp;\nJongerius continues to have materials largely determine the design direction at Jongeriuslab, and combines ancient craft technique with modern technology.&amp;nbsp; Layers Garden Double is another beautiful example of this philosophy. It is not only an excellent example of contemporary textiles, but also documents a project that began with the Sampler Blanket. Together these textiles weave a narrative about the works as a creative endeavor and reveal the importance of handwork and machine production in each. ",
