    "justification": "This piece of In the White Room is a recent production of a design realized in 2002, when it was first shown at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) in New York. The length is from a wallpaper series and could be used alone or in groups. It is one of several three-dimensional wallcoverings designed and produced by Tracy Kendall, a designer who does not believe walls need to be represented in two dimensions. \nKendall began her wallpaper career in 1996, screen printing large-scale designs of feathers, plants, and cutlery. These panels could be used alone or in groups, and stood over seven feet tall. Her bespoke line of three-dimensional wallcoverings followed and includes this design as well as papers with sequins, jigsaw puzzle pieces, buttons, and fringe. Kendall\u2019s bespoke wallpapers are almost all light in color, which allows for the most dramatic play of light and shadow. All of her panels are custom-sized for individual interiors\u2014this panel length of 10 feet is about average. In the White Room is one of her most popular designs.\nKendall studied Fine Art Printmaking in Manchester and works out of her studio in London. She has shown her work at many design fairs including the ICFF, the Milan Furniture Fair, 100% Design, and the Chelsea Craft Fair. Her work has received much publicity in a wide variety of publications including Interior Design, Metropolis, Elle Decor, Marie Claire UK, Vogue Living Australia, Israeli Press, Craft, and Casa Abitare.\nKendall\u2019s approach to wallpaper design is innovative and unusual; In the White Room would be the first example of her work in the museum\u2019s collection. Contemporary British production is an area of collection interest, and these pieces will help keep our holdings up-to-date while also adding new depth to our collection of relief wallcoverings.",
