    "description": "Orange French newspaper montage that has been nearly completely erased; with only a few identifiable areas of text.",
    "justification": "Bridges on the Seine, by Bi Xue Feng, is a response to the ubiquitous architectural typology so readily identifiable with the French capital. According to the designer, the typography reflects the advertising placed along the river banks. The upper and lower halves of the text are more or less split in two, echoing the right and left banks of the Seine.\nXue Feng graduated from the China Academy of Art in 1989. In 1997, he founded his firm, Imagram Graphic Design Inc., in Shenzhen, China. In addition to running a full-service graphic design company, he is interested in design theory and lectures around the world at many graphic design symposia. His work has been shown at national and international exhibitions, including those in Paris, Zurich, Brno, the Czech Republic, and Germany; he is also the recipient of many graphic design awards. \nIn 2005, Xue Feng was awarded a four-month residency in Paris by the Cit\u00e9 internationale des Arts, Paris, an arts foundation that provides residencies for professional artists who want to develop their work in France. The Cit\u00e9 also sponsors exhibitions where visual artists can display their work. Bridges on the Seine was created during the designer\u2019s Paris sojourn.\nThis is one of two posters by Xue Feng proposed for acquisition as part of the museum\u2019s effort to add examples of contemporary Chinese graphic design to the museum\u2019s collection.",
