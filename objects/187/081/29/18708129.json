    "description":"In this view, the Grand Duchess Cecilia von Oldenburg's study is dominated by the large wall-hung portrait on the right of a man in military uniform, possibly the Grand Duke Paul Friedrich.  Pale yellow walls with trails of flowers and a floral carpet of the same coloration create a background for the elegant suite of Biedermeier furniture. The ormolu-mounted desk holds two porcelain vases, perhaps from the Imperial Porcelain Manufactory of Russia. A reflection of the bronze sculpture of Psyche is seen in the tall mirror behind the desk on the left. Books, small pictures and a sewing box-on-stand create a very personal study for a duchess.",
