    "description": "This is a sketch of the late seventeenth century library at Cassiobury Park after it had been redecorated by James Wyatt around 1800. The huge room measured fifty-four by twenty-three feet. The walls are hung with family portraits, as well as works by Joshua Reynolds, Rubens, Van Dyck, Cornelius Janssens, Peter Lely and Godfrey Kneller. The carved frame of the Reynolds is by Grinling Gibbons. Three arched windows, separated by pier mirrors, are hung with elaborate swagged and fringed curtains; a central lantern lights the room; and library tables and chairs show figures at study. (In a later view of the library, a geometrically patterned rug is in place.)",
