    "description":"The salon is dominated by a Gothic style organ on the left at which a woman is seated; she is dressed in a white costume dated to the 1830s. A crystal and ormolu counterweighted chandelier is suspended from the Neo-Classical style vaulted ceiling. The windows in the rear are dressed in the Regency style, with deep fringe-edged swags, caught by a large eagle at top center. The Grecian style sofa in the foreground; desk in the Louis XVI style, with books and Chinese porcelains; chimney surround of the Adamesque period (1770s); and large porcelain vases and jars reflect a room of decoration spanning sixty years.",
