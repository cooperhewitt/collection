    "description": "The angled view of this study is dominated by portraits: large oval portraits dating from the Empire period and smaller pictures from the 1820s-1830s. Racks of pipes near the door in the rear and a large businessman's desk in the center foreground show that the room belongs to a man. A large woven urn-shaped basket in the  foreground next to the desk may have served as a wastepaper basket. On the left, a library table sits in front of a banquette. The bare floor of wood planks is in keeping with the Biedermeier style.",
