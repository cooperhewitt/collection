    "description":"This room in the residence of Governor Baron von Wernhardt is in the Viennese Biedermeier style. The man in military uniform in the large portrait on the right is presumed to be Ferdinand I (1792-1875). The three windows at the rear are dressed in white curtains; flowered bolsters on the sills serve to block the cold, mountainous weather. The cabinets, banquettes, mirrors and sidetables are of stark 1830s Biedermeier design, as is the bare parquet floor. The occasional chairs display the curved line of the Rococo Revival. The walls are papered in a large patterned stripe.",
