    "description":"This is possibly a view of the winter garden of the Pavlino Palace of the Wittgenstein family. The conservatory, here transformed for a ball, shows a floor covered with large parquet squares; a chandelier consisting of eight Argand lamps and two additional single fixtures; and chairs set about. A shawl and bouquet of flowers are placed on chairs in the left foreground. The dominant theme of the room is the exuberant display of roses and clematis and ferns, interspersed with classical marble statues.",
