    "description":"This large salon is sparsely furnished in the Biedermeier style. Atop the blond wood secretary is a gilt bronze lyre clock, flanked by classical busts. The upholstered banquette-and-matching-wall covering is a device used by Leo von Klenze, architect, and originally by his mentor, Schinkel. Mid-century porcelains, placed on Empire consoles, are reflected in tall mirrors. A great porcelain stove at right is partially concealed by a needlepoint fire screen.\n\nThe portrait on the center wall (upper row, second from left)  probably depicts of Eugene de Beauharnais, son of Josephine.",
