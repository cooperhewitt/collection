    "description":"French artists who won the Prix de Rome were given studios in which to live and work during their time spent in Rome. The Academie de France occupied the Villa Medici on Monte Pincio from 1803. Three artists are seen in this room, which is sparsely furnished with simple wooden chairs, work tables and workstands. Folding beds, which would have been set up at night, were probably stored in the daytime behind the blue striped curtain in the right foreground. Paintings, plaster casts and portfolios are placed around the room. A pair of pistols mounted on a pedestal was carried for protection during sketching expeditions. A snake and a tortoise, presumably pets, are in open view.",
