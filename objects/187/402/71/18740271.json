    "justification": "Ward Bennett became increasingly fascinated with simple geometric forms in the 1980s. This model is part of a group of prototype models in wood and plaster for ceramic forms such as vases and bowls. The models show a preoccupation with the juxtaposition of circles, half-circles, squares, and triangles, which is also found in Bennett\u2019s decorative elements, lamp bases, and furniture. The stacked prototypes of the circle\/square\/triangle can be documented back to 1986 by dated photographs, shortly before Bennett became Design Director for the Geiger furniture company in 1987.\nThese prototypes are proposed for acquisition along with a selection of Bennett\u2019s models for chairs and design and production process drawings for flatware. The design process materials under consideration would expand our understanding and collection of Bennett\u2019s work. In addition, acquisitions involving material in one department that support holdings in other departments contribute to the strength of our permanent holdings.",
