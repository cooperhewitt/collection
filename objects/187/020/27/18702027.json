    "description": "Upright rectangular form composed of stacked shallow plywood boxes; the top box designed as seat, with well to accept removeable cushion.  Band of molding and five applied vertical wood strips decorate each side of seat; lower sections have incised linear decoration at corners.  Sections can be stacked to make stool of varying height.  Seat section designed to serve as galleried tray when cushion removed.",
    "justification": "Noted American architect, E. Fay Jones, was a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright. Jones is primarily known as the creator of the Ozark style of architecture, although his buildings are located throughout the United States. His designs for houses, chapels, and churches are hailed as organic and site-sensitive. Influenced by his training under Wright, the designs often rely on cedar siding, shingles, and stone. Jones is probably best known for the Thorncrown Chapel (built 1980) in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. In 2000, the tall, light, tensile structure of glass, wood, and stone was voted the fourth-best building of the 20th century by the American Institute of Architects. In 1980, Jones won a Rome Prize Fellowship and, in 1990, he received the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. Although his work shows an affinity for Wright\u2019s approach and designs, Jones\u2019s designs have a character of their own. They manifest his passion for the history of architecture, his engineering background, his eye for pragmatic detail, and his concern for needs of the client. \nThis stool is from Jones\u2019s own residence, his first building, which he designed in 1955. Jones also designed most of the furnishings. Like his house, the furnishings are marked by an elegant visual simplicity and structural clarity reliant on strong geometric forms and subtle, minimal, linear embellishment. The stool is part of a suite for use around the Joneses\u2019 dining table and in the living room. Economical in concept and execution, the form is simply a stack of hollow plywood boxes with a lift-off lid topped with a cushion. The simple incised lines and moldings applied to the seat amplify the elegant rectilinear quality of the form. The boxes were also designed to serve as storage containers, some with square frames that could be mixed and matched and stacked to any height. According to Jones\u2019s wife, a local cabinet shop constructed the components at a cost of $4 per stool.\nThis stool would add to our American 20th-century architect-designed seating and to our group of multi-function furniture. \nReferences:\nRobert Adams Ivy, Fay Jones: the architecture of E.
