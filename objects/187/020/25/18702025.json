    "justification": "This braided space tether, which was designed in 2001 by by Dr. Robert P. Hoyt and manufactured in 2004 by Tethers Unlimited, Inc., is made out of one of the strongest fibers available today, manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd. The textile acts as a momentum-exchange tether that takes advantage of the momentum of a body in orbit to \u201cthrow\u201d a payload, such as a satellite, into a different orbit. Such an apparatus could be adapted for the low-fuel transportation of loads to the moon or perhaps, even farther. Its rust colored, multi-line braid of Zylon\u00aePBO with braided interconnections is designed to prevent all the strands from being severed or damaged. This textile has a high performance application, and demonstrates that strength can come from fibers a fraction of the diameter of its metal counterpart.",
