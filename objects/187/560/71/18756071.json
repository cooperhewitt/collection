    "description": "A pitcher in the shape of a pilgrim's flask with small, knob handles occupies the upper half of the sheet. The vessel has a peacock-blue body and is decorated with suspended yellow wisteria blossoms and six flying moths below.  The vessel is illustrated in elevation from both sides and also seen in plan.  The pitcher is trimmed by a thin red border on all sides.  A matching footed basin in plan and elevation occupies the lower half of the sheet.  A ring of smaller yellow wisteria blossoms creates a wide border around the basin, while the bowl is pale green bordered by darker green moths.  The bowl and basin rim are trimmed with red.",
