    "justification": "In 1980, Bill Moggridge and his firm had the opportunity to design a complete computer. The result was the GRiD Compass portable computer, considered to be one of the first laptop computers. \nThe initial brief was to design the exterior case: a minimal, low, rectangular black box, the top horizontally bisected with a hinged section that lifts to reveal the screen and keyboard. Upon taking a prototype home and using it, Moggridge found that the user\u2019s interaction with the object (hardware) and the software was just as important as the design of the physical form. Object and user interaction were both essential design elements that combined to create a complete experience.\nThis prototype for the GRiD Compass was featured in the museum\u2019s exhibition Design USA: Contemporary Innovation (2009\u201310). The museum acquired a production model of the GRiD Compass laptop in the 1990s. The prototype of this seminal design would be an important addition to help tell the story of the design process and innovations in the (then) nascent field of interaction design. Differences include screen size, which is smaller in the prototype, and the presence of instructional markings above the prototype\u2019s keyboard.",
    "gallery_text": "Bill Moggridge designed what many consider the first personal laptop, first defined as a computer small enough to travel within a briefcase. The GRiD Compass featured many design innovations that contemporary models still have: a clamshell hinge, a flat screen, and recessed keyboard. Moggridge recognized the importance of how the user interacted with both the machine\u2019s hardware and software. This concept still guides work done at the international design firm IDEO where Moggridge was a co-founder.",
    "label_text": "The screen of the GRiD Compass flips up to reveal a keyboard. Costing around $8,000, the GRiD was employed for elite business, government, and military applications. The GRiD was launched as desktop computers were about to become viable tools for homes and offices. Moggridge pioneered the emerging field of interaction design, which addresses the relationship between people and software.",
