    "justification": "The Woman Taking Coffee is a perfect example of the pastel manner, a newly invented technique in 18th-century French printmaking and one perfected by Louis-Marin Bonnet. The colorful effect of this print, suggestive of a pastel portrait, is enhanced by the use of gold leaf. \nBonnet entered the atelier of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher after 1757 and began engraving copies after Boucher\u2019s chalk drawings. To better replicate the intricate tonalities of pastel portraits and nude studies, Bonnet worked to perfect the engraving technique referred to as \u201cthe chalk manner.\u201d Jean-Charles Fran\u00e7ois was among the first to develop the technique in France. Bonnet carried the technique beyond the typical red or brown colored engravings that provided facsimiles of acad\u00e9mies for use by students to produce tour-de-force images in full color that appealed to sophisticated print collectors. \nBuilding on technical developments pioneered by Fran\u00e7ois, which included specially designed engraving roulettes with irregular teeth that scored the plate to simulate a more spontaneous line, as well as the invention of soft-ground etching techniques that could produce the soft, grainy look of a chalk line, Bonnet would use up to eight separate plates, each individually worked in roulette and often laboriously inked \u00e0 la poup\u00e9e to mimic the effect of blended pastel tones. As popular as these pastel manner prints were, Bonnet produced an even more beautiful series of prints in 1774 that incorporated the motif of a carved frame finished in gold leaf to resemble portrait miniatures. \nIn France in 1774, however, the use of gold leaf was restricted to those artisans who specialized in gilding for furniture or book binding. To circumvent this regulation, Bonnet constructed an elaborate scheme to monopolize the market for these prints by advertising them as imported from England\u2014and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the French guild regulations. The prints bear the name of a fictitious British artist, one \u201cL. Marin,\u201d whose name is derived from Bonnet\u2019s own; the publisher is listed as Vivares, a family of print sellers in Old Newport Street, London. In Paris, Bonnet was the sole purveyor of these \u201cestampes anglaises,&quot; which sold for nine livres each. \nThe Woman Taking Coffee is a particularly beautiful example and represents a high degree of technical accomplishment, with the addition of a separate plate, inked \u00e0 la poup\u00e9e, to color the sleeve and neck ribbon mauve and to add the pale green stripes to her scarf. The method of applying the gold leaf to the paper is identical to the method employed by gilders: first, a layer of white or red is printed to serve as a bole for the gold. In The Woman Taking Coffee, Bonnet uses gold beyond the frame, substituting gold for yellow inks in the chair frame and the edges of the coffee cup and saucer to enhance the overall composition.\nThis particularly fine example of color engraving enhances the museum\u2019s collection of color printing from France, as well as our rich collection of 18th-century French prints.",
