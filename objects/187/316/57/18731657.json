    "justification": "The New England Glass Company made a large variety of glassware, from pocket bottles and tumblers to art glass, using a range of techniques including molding, mechanical pressing, cutting, and engraving. It produced some of the finest blown glass in the United States, competitive with European examples. The glass had a high lead content, simple outlines, and was carefully finished. The firm was also famous for its rich colors, especially ruby red and the amberina range, a blended colored glass in which the lower part, a yellowish amber, merges into a ruby-red color higher up, as exemplified in this vase. An example of American technological innovation, the amberina technique was patented by the New England Glass Company in 1883. The base metal was an amber glass containing some gold, and the tinges were developed by applied reheating. The glass was sometimes blown in molds, although this example appears to be hand-blown.\nThis vase is in excellent condition and would make a superb addition to the museum\u2019s collection of innovative American glassware.",
    "gallery_text": "The New England Glass Company was famous for its amberina range, in which successive firings melted metal elements in the glass to enable a gradual shift of color\u2014from a yellowish color at the base to a ruby red higher up. Red, a notoriously fugitive color, escaped re-firing at the top.",
