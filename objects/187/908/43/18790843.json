    "description": "Multiple full views of a handle with a slightly curved end.  The handle is seen from both sides in elevation with a cross-section through at right.  Below are two views of the same handle seen in cross-section through the handle's shaft.  Materials and dimensions are specified throughout.  The drawing space is not ruled and is framed at right by a title block that is perpendicular to the drawing.",
    "justification": "Smart Design and OXO Good Grips kitchen tools rank among the most successful domestic consumer products of the late 20th century. When they were first issued 1992, the museum acquired examples of the full line of OXO Good Grips kitchen tools as a gift from the OXO company. These drawings from the first series of Good Grips products help document the use of new materials and ergonometric principles in the design process of the firm Smart Design, which received the design commission for these products from OXO\u2019s founder, Sam Farber. \nThese proposed drawings are not conceptual sketches. According to Smart Design\u2019s principals, Dan Formosa and Davin Stowell (Tucker Viemeister, the third original principal, is no longer with the firm), Smart Design rarely executes concept sketches for its projects. They most frequently work with existing products that they refashion by adding foam or other materials to achieve a three-dimensional mock-up of their new product. The drawings proposed for acquisition are fabrication drawings from the final early model for the production of the prototypes. The Good Grips drawings are especially instructive because they represent a period at the end of the 1980s when designers were transitioning between drawing by hand and drawing over photocopies to the early 1990s when they turned to computer-generated drawings. \nIncluded in the proposed group are three drawings for the OXO Good Grips lemon peeler, two drawings for the pizza wheel, one drawing for the garlic press, and three computer-generated drawings for the \"universal handle.\u201d According to Stowell, who executed the \u201cuniversal handle\u201d drawings, they represent his earliest experience with generating designs solely by computer. \nThese design drawings will enable us to explain and display the evolution of these iconic kitchen implements, and speak to Smart Design\u2019s ongoing design process and concern for consumer needs.",
