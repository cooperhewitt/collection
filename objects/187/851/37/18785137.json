    "justification":"This textile, Lippen, is a textile in The Anatomical Design series, which was initially part of Visiona 0, an exhibition from 1968. The exhibition showcased a futurist environment that included furniture, lighting, and textiles, the combination of which caused a visually interesting and almost psychedelic effect. Round rooms of various colors were bedecked with draperies and round carpets printed with large photorealist representations of hands, feet, mouths (seen here), eyes and ears. The model for these body parts was the designer\u2019s wife, Marianne. Later on, the Swiss textile company, Mira-X, which had a long-time collaboration with Panton, produced these designs under the name of Anatomic. The Visiona series continued until the mid-1970s under Panton\u2019s leadership and featured such illustrious designers as Joe Colombo.&amp;nbsp; However, the focus shifted to featuring only home textiles rather than presenting Panton\u2019s idea of a model living environment crafted by new technical innovation and the implementation of synthetic materials.",
