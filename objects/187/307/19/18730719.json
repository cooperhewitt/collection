    "justification": "In recent years both the USSR (in 1979) and the USA (in 2001) have invaded Afghanistan in response to the threat of Islamist terrorism, and in between the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and the current war on terrorism came a decade of brutal civil war. Through these three decades of international and civil war, Afghans have borne witness to disaster by weaving unprecedented images of battles and weaponry into their rugs. \nMost traditional oriental rugs share the same layout: a patterned center field, like a garden, framed on all sides by a protective border. The earliest war rugs, from the period of the Soviet occupation (1979-1989), often share this format. They look like typical floral carpets, until upon closer inspection one notices the tanks and helicopters neatly hidden in the body of the rug or encircling its border. In later rugs, like this particular example, the field and border format has been abandoned, and landscapes are drawn from multiple shifting vantage points. Television imagery, from CNN and al-Jazeera, has also influenced rug-weaving. Fractured scenes with multiple images and moving lines of text appear on the rugs, just as they do on television screens. Other rugs look more like propaganda posters. The weapons and vehicles are presented graphically in large scale on a solid ground, and are usually drawn so realistically that the exact model can be identified. During the Soviet occupation, Soviet weapons appeared. In more recent rugs, American weapons are featured. ",
