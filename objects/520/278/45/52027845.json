    "description": "Design contains delicately embroidered circular shapes appearing somewhat randomly placed with some overlapping on a white woven ground. Each of the motifs is embroidered in one of three colors: gray, black or tan with the tan being the largest, the gray medium and the black the smallest in size. The woven backing and embroidery have a slight sheen.",
    "justification": "Carnegie Fabrics produces heavy duty woven fabrics and wallcoverings used mostly in the commercial trade. Each woven fabric is used for both furnishings and wallcoverings, where the fabric is paper-backed to facilitate pasting to the wall. \nFounded by Robert Goldman in1950, Carnegie Fabrics is a family-owned business with a commitment to quality and innovation. The research and development of sustainable textiles is one of the company\u2019s priorities. Carnegie has always tried to achieve higher standards than the minimum requirements established by the government. Carnegie was the first manufacturer of heavy duty fabrics to be totally PVC free. \"Artisan Embroidery\" is from the Xorel line of high-performance textiles which are of great importance to the hospitality and health industries due to its inherent characteristics. This pattern contains delicately embroidered circular shapes on a woven ground. Each of the circles is embroidered in tan, gray or black, and the change of scale and overlapping shapes makes the design playful and creates a sense of depth. Xorel was introduced by Carnegie Fabrics in 1981 and was the first textile to address long-term issues of maintenance and safety in commercial interiors. It is woven and embroidered using 100% polyethylene yarns and is more durable than vinyl while also being a healthier alternative. Xorel contains no chlorine, plasticizers, heavy metals, toxic dyes or ozone-depleting chemicals so there is virtually no off-gassing. Polyethylene is inherently flame-retardant, stain-resistant, antimicrobial, non-absorbent and can even be cleaned with a diluted bleach solution. Xorel is Cradle to Cradle certified Silver. The only downside to this product was the polyethylene which was derived from fossil fuels, a non-renewable resource.",
