    "gallery_text": "Joseph Friedman\u2019s best-known invention is the flexible straw and the company he formed to manufacture it became the focus of his inventive life. He frequently sketched on loose scraps of paper\u2014he was especially fond of envelopes\u2014working out ideas and solving problems. His pencil sketch of the flexible straw captures his method at its very best. Dating from the 1930s, it is the first example of Friedman experimenting with this idea. The pencil lines were drawn quickly but with purpose, but the sketch is whimsical, too, at first glance recalling a flower wilting in a vase. Friedman\u2019s flexible straw, called a \"Drinking Tube,\" was granted US Patent 2,094,268 on September 28, 1937.",
