Best-known for inventing the flexible straw, Friedman designed a range of objects, including writing implements, improvements to engines, household products, and, of course, this safety razor handle. He explained his invention in earlier sketches: \"One purpose is a convenient and readily accessible place for carrying additional blades; another to combine in one article the razor and the blade container box; and a further purpose is to provide a large comfortable handle which is very easy to grasp and effects a good grip and perfect control of the movements of the razor-head.\" Friedman received nine United States patents and several foreign ones over the course of his long career.",
