    "justification": "Paula Scher\u2019s work for The Public Theater began in 1994 when she was retained by the The Public\u2019s producer, George C. Wolfe, to design the organization\u2019s graphic identity.&amp;nbsp; In seeking to provide a visual identity that responded to the theater\u2019s mission as an accessible community theater, Scher drew inspiration from the streets of New York City to create a series of graphics that responded to both the grid-structure of the streets and the language of graffiti.&amp;nbsp; The posters that Scher has designed for The Public Theater have become iconic emblems not only of the plays that they have advertised, but the cultural moments in which they have been produced, for with each season Scher\u2019s designs allude to the pressing or pervasive social, economic and political issues of the day.",
