    "justification": "Victorinox calls the Victorinox@work \u201cthe next generation\u201d of Swiss Army knives. Introduced in 2011, this multitool was designed for daily tasks in the electronic age. Lightweight and a diminutive 2.75 inches long, the translucent red plastic and stainless steel housing holds not only traditional implements (blade, combination nail file\/screw driver, scissors, key ring, tweezers, and ball point pen), but also has a detachable 4GB USB flash drive for capturing, transporting, and transferring digital data\u2014a 21st-century update for a tool that originated in the late 19th century. \nThe Victorinox@work is proposed for acquisition together with the Swiss Champ SOS. Together, they would be the first examples of Swiss Army multitools to enter the museum\u2019s collection.",
    "gallery_text": "The Swiss Army knife, as its name suggests, began as a practical tool for the Swiss military. First produced in the late 1880s by a German manufacturer, the archetypical multipurpose device was developed by a Swiss cutler, Karl Elsener, in 1891. Today, the form and the emblem seem to inspire the confidence of contemporary consumers, whether as knife, a compact emergency tool kit, or, as in this case, as an implement for the digital age. This lightweight example contains not only traditional instruments\u2014blade, combination nail file and screwdriver, scissors, key ring, tweezers, and retractable pen\u2014but also a detachable USB (Universal Serial Bus) flash drive for use with computers and other electronic devices. This model indicates the ways in which daily tasks and the associated tools have changed the 122-year-old tool for the 21st-century user.",
    "label_text": "There is a long tradition of technical economy, of individual tools performing multiple tasks\u2014the ancient handaxe is an elegant example. It shares design features with the Victorinox@work and iPhone: portability, tactility, and good fit for the hand, yet each of their many functions reflects the particular needs and technology of its era.",
