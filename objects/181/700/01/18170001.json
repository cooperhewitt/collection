She is talking to one pupil, who stands before her, as she checks his writing book; another pupil stands behind, waiting his turn for her inspection.  Five more pupils are seated in the background, performing their assignments; one pupil enters the doorway at right.  books, notably a grammar of Aelius (inscribed \"DONATUS\" is on the floor at the lower left, at the foot of Grammatica's ornate chair (decorated with the bust of a winged sphinx). The scene is set within an architectural framework.  \"GRAMMA\/TICA\" is inscribed in an escutcheon at top, center, flanked by two putti.  Two escutcheons arranged at the bottom center bear the faint initials: \"H\" (at left); and \"L\" (at right); the 1606 date is inscribed \"16\" to the left of the left escutcheon and \"06\" to the right of the right escutcheon.  A laurel-wreathed man's head (a bust) is in the niche to the left of the main scene, above a putto and an animal's head.",
