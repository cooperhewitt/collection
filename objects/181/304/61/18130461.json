    "description": "Fragment of woven silk with large tangent roundels. Each roundel contains a symmetrical design of a bearded man strangling a lion in each arm. A small animal is under each lion's feet and a pair of small birds appear between the strangler's feet. The roundel frame consists of confronted griffons with pearl guard bands. \nThe ornament in the interspaces consists of three concentric 8-pointed stars surrounded by eight radiating plant forms (pointed decorative trees alternating with scrolls terminating in palmettes). \nAt the bottom of the piece, a horizontal band of ornamented Kufic script repeats (upside down) written normally and in reverse with guilloche guard bands. \nIn dark green and crimson on cream ground fading into yellow in some areas. Face, hands, feet, belt disks of lion strangler, and heads of lions are brocaded with cream silk wound with gilded vellum.",

    "gallery_text": "This rare textile depicting a figure known as the \u201clion strangler\u201d is a fragment of a tunic, or dalmatic, from the tomb of Saint Bernat Calv\u00f3 (1180-1243) in Vich Cathedral, Barcelona. Calv\u00f3 was bishop of Vich and accompanied James I, king of Aragon, during the capture of Valencia from the Moors in 1238. This textile may be part of the spoils of this conquest. It was woven in Spain, possibly in the silk production center of Almer\u00eda, under the Almoravid Dynasty, the Amazigh (Berber) rulers from 1090 to 1150. \nA hero strangling a lion was an enduring motif in the ancient Middle East. Possibly referring to the myth of Gilgamesh or Herakles, it was considered a symbol of Persian royal power. When medieval Islamic weavers brought the motif to Europe, Christians interpreted it as a depiction of the Biblical story of Daniel in the lion\u2019s den. In this fragment, each roundel features this scene and is surrounded with bands of pearls and griffins. It also contains an upturned Kufic inscription which reads \u201cal-yumn,\u201d or prosperity.",
