    "description":"Horizontal rectangle. A fluted band with rosettes in the corners below, stars in those above, frames. The panels beside the opening, below, outside laterally above. On either side stands the half figure of an armless winged woman with leaves at the lower parts of the body. They support with their outer wings a festoon upon which stands in the middle of the front a sun disk with a rule. Above is a frieze with cornices on top; it is decorated with four masks. In the intervals between them are, at left: an eye with branches, in the center branches, at right: a mason's tools and branches. Instead of the frieze is suggested with pencil an entablature with cornices. Inside is a pencil sketch of a mantelpiece with an opening being lower than the standing figures. The wall is colored.",
