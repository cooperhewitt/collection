Window treatment consists of blue fabric dotted with pink spots, gathered in center and corners to create short festoon and pleats on either side.  This valence lays over a pale pink curtain, also gathered just above the center of the window frame on either side, yielding a soft drape and pleats.  Both curtains and valence are ornamented with yellow fringe having darked eneds.  Tiebacks match fringe.",
