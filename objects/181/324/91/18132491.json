A lion below looks back over his shoulder. Two additional figures, one at each side, wear spotted green clothing. The rider is in pink with a flowing blue cape. Inner border of polychrome connected flower heads on a natural ground; outer border of polychrome step pattern on dark blue ground. \nThe image is said to represent the emperor with two Persian prisoners, a reference to the victory of Heraclius (617 - 641) over the Persians in 627.",
