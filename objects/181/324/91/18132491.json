    "description": "Tapestry medallion with polychrome figures on a red ground. In the center field, a haloed rider on a prancing horse carries a staff or scepter topped with a trefoil, and holds a ring. A lion below looks back over his shoulder. Two additional figures, one at each side, wear spotted green clothing. The rider is in pink with a flowing blue cape. Inner border of polychrome connected flower heads on a natural ground; outer border of polychrome stepped pattern on dark blue ground. \nThe image is said to represent the emperor with two Persian prisoners, a reference to the victory of Heraclius (617 - 641) over the Persians in 627.",

    "gallery_text": "Egyptians in the Byzantine (fourth-seventh century C.E.) and early Islamic (seventh-tenth century C.E.) periods often decorated garments with woven designs.  Most common among these designs were orbiculi (roundels on the shoulders and abdomen), segmenta (ornamental squares in the same places) and clavi (vertical stripes running from the inner shoulder past the breasts).  This example of an orbiculum likely decorated a tunic.  Since tunics were mostly pain linen and frequently damaged, it was common for 19th and early 20th century collectors and dealers to cut out decorative elements and sell or display them separately.  This seems to have been the case with this example, which is almost identical to clavus 1902-1-22 in material, weave, and style. Hunter iconography was popular in Byzantine and early Islamic Egypt, particularly for funerary use. The inscription on this orbiculum is illegible, but the inscription on the matching clavus reads, \u201cLong Live,\u201d emphasizing the wearer\u2019s triumph over death.",
