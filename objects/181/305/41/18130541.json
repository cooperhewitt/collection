These motifs alternate colors across each row: off-white, silver, yellow-green, silver, etc. In one row, peacocks facing right. In the next row, a smaller-scale motif of a tree with two birds at the base. In the next row, pelicans facing left, with the inscription \"PELYCE\" on the wing. In the final row, trees again with a duck and a hedgehog at the base.",
