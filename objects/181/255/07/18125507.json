    "description": "Elevation of a free-standing circular monument, positioned at the center of the sheet.  The monument stands on a circular base and is reached via steps.  The pedestals projecting from the stairs carry burning candelabra.  The monument itself is comprised of three parts: cylindrical base, smaller cylindrical mid-section, and rectangular top.  At the first level, two female figures sit on a rectangular pedestal\/bench.  Their backs are turned away from each other and hands cover their faces.  Above, on the drum, in relief, two winged figures carry a round medallion decorated with a head in profile.  On each side of the drum (left and right) is a seated figure.  Their heads are covered by the head scarves.  At the monument's mid-section, at the bottom, winged figures stand on pedestals at equal intervals.  The upper portion of the drum is decorated with a festoon ring.  The top of the monument is reserved for the sarcophagus elevated on a high pedestal.  At its base, at the center of each side, sits a female figure in a regal pose.",
