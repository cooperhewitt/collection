    "description": "Design for a wall panel.  At the bottom, two satyrs sacrifice flowers at the foot of a burning candelabrum. The satyrs support, with their heads, two half female figures (half female and half flower stem).  The figures hold a medallion with a maenad.  A putto, supporting a vase, stands on top of the medallion. At the very to center of the composition are two billing doves and at the edges two putti.  The putti hold festoons and garlands from which then flower baskets are suspended.  The doves hold long garlands, which are then connected to two female figures (one at each side of the central composition).  These female figures in turn stand on long decorative spears, which rest on the end tips of the half female figures.",

    "gallery_text": "This design for a decorative panel offers a variation on the grotesque motif, an ornamental style that was first seen in ancient Rome. Characterized by the non-narrative assembly of fantastic animals on a two dimensional surface, grotesques were capable of limitless permutations and invited the imagination of countless designers throughout the centuries. The design is host to a lively cast of classical figures: cavorting satyrs, graceful caryatids and plump putti are all connected by a system of garlands and candelabra, together forming a strong vertical axis. Jean-Guillaume Moitte, working in pre-revolutionary France, had stylistic affinities with Ancien R\u00e9gime designers such as Jean Berain, who helped to popularize the grotesque in the seventeenth century. Moitte designed the panel as part of a commission for the H\u00f4tel de Salm in Paris; the artist was one of the main sculptors hired to work on the building, then the private residence of Prince Frederick III of Salm-Kyrburg. The bright turquoise gouache of the drawing is typical of the highly saturated color palette then popular for domestic interiors.",

The bright turquoise gouache is typical of the highly saturated color palette then popular for domestic interiors. The design is a variation on the grotesque motif, characterized by a non-narrative assembly of fantastic animals.\nIn 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
