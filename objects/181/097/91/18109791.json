    "description":"A fragment of an extensively decorated wall.  The rendering occupies the entire sheet.  Above the space for the door opening is a representation of flying Eros and Psyche.  The lower part of the wall is treated as a dado, having friezes with two intertwined rows of festoons.  The main panel is an imaginary painting of Psyche, having won the favor of the goddess Ceres by arranging in due order the heaps of grain scattered in front of her temple.  This panel appears to hang in front of a red panel, decorated with a motif of candelabra at left and right as well as with a motif of festoons with putti and satyrs, above and below.  Other smaller panels, to the left of the door opening and to the right of the main panel, contain images of Eros (left) and Psyche (right).",
