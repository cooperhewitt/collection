    "description":"Elevation of a wall.  The center of the design is a chimney with a large mirror above. At the base of the mirror, standing on the mantel, are two statues of a child on a cloud, holding a torch.  The mirror is flanked by composite columns with which pilasters on either side of the doorway correspond.  Between the columns and the pilasters are two female statues.  There is a door opening on either side, at the edges of the sheet.   Above the doors, in arched over doors, are reliefs of seated figures among trophies of arms.   An entablature separates this section of the wall from an attic.  In the attic, at the center, two winged statues with trumpets open a curtain.  Decorative panels on either side of this grouping show figures with large oval mirrors\/medallions.",
