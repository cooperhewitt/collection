    "description": "Shown from the left front corner.  Plant motifs stand in the middle and at the corners of the roof.  Tassels hand from the latter.  Festoons with roses hand from the entablature.  The panels are framed by garlands consisting of acorns and pairs of leaves.  Ovoid medallions are shown below and beside the windows. That at the doors shows an urn, that below the lateral window a fashionably dressed man sitting beside a pyramid, that beside it a woman with a sensor leaf.  Festoons and rosettes are amply used in the decoration.  The disk with the superimposed garland occurs too.  The foot is framed by a winged sphinx.  The bar is decorated in the width of the chair with two intertwined garlands.  The mountings of the bar are shown at left standing upon a meadow.",
