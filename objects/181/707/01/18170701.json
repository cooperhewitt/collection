For the center: including flower vases on brackets with doves and a spike design with vegetable motifs and shells.  The ceiling is divided by bands into the central, circular and four pentagonal coffers. Three alternative suggestions are made for the letters. Two of them show bracket motifs and putti.  One is decorated with an acanthus scroll from which a Bacchus gaine rises; a female head, a three-quarter figure of a child, rustic musical instruments are in the framing. The fourth shows a sphinx under a canopy, a festoon held by a half-figure.",
