    "description": "Design for a bedroom.  Only the main wall is depicted.  Three steps lead up to an alcove, the center of which is occupied by a bed.  The bed is framed by a drapery, pulled back by two female statues.  Unevenly spaced columns support the front entablature.  Four candelabra stand between the columns.  The candelabra are composed of a warrior and a girl supporting trays with candlesticks.  The wall behind is richly ornamented with reliefs.  Two main relief panels show two figures leaning against large oval medallions.  At the top, is a part of a curved ceiling, showing two captives and trophies of weapons, two girls beside an escutcheon, a segment of a painting, the sky, and putti.  At the far left is shown a small fragment of the elevation of the alcove niche and a part of a wing of a folding door.  At the bottom of the composition is an indication of the scale: 12 Pieds.",
