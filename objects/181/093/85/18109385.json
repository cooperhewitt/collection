    "description": "Only the left half of the tower visible. The tower consists of an oblong room with a balcony (in the middle of the entablature), a high candelabrum with lamps and three lamps of small sizes in left corner.  The plan of the tower is hexagonal.  In front of its first section above, the dado is shown, an ovoid medallion with a half length portrait of a female saint carried by an angel.  Rows of candle brackets flank it.  The next section shows at the front a row of lamps which are connected by festoons, with the one at the front at left holding a thread.  The statues are flanked by candelabra with burning candles.  The next section consists of steps and a pedestal with rows of lamps at the corners and two angels raising a sensor at the front.  A bishop stands above upon clouds containing many angels.  A glory of light surrounds him.  Below are a scale and the signature written with ink: \"Dorn Ant. Vaccaro nip.\"",
