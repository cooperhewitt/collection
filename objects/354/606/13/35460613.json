    "justification":"Selected for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1950 exhibition &quot;Twentieth Century Glass, American and European&quot;, this vase&amp;nbsp;was one of fifty works in the exhibition, and Blenko was&amp;nbsp;one of the few American companies, appearing with equal status as European counterparts such as&amp;nbsp;Emil Galle,&amp;nbsp; Orrefors, and Louis&amp;nbsp;Comfort Tiffany. &amp;nbsp;Technically listed in a circa 1940 catalogue on the&quot;Heavy Swedish type&quot; page&amp;nbsp;without designer, the vase, the only one of this series with an applied coil, was almost certainly&amp;nbsp;the design of Carl Ebert Erickson, the foreman and de facto&amp;nbsp;chief designer&amp;nbsp;of Blenko&amp;nbsp;into World War II.&amp;nbsp; Erickson had worked at the Pairpoint Factory prior to coming to Blenko and came from a line of Swedish glassmakers: both his father and grandfather were master blowers at the Reimyre factory in Sweden.&amp;nbsp; Erickson left Blenko to found his own company, Erickson Glassworks in Ohio. His departure was the inspiration for Blenko, soon after the war, to hire&amp;nbsp;its first&amp;nbsp;full-time, in-house designer, Winthrop Anderson.\n&amp;nbsp;",
