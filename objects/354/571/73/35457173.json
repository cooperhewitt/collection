    "gallery_text": "The mechanization of the textile industry in America was the catalyst for the great Industrial Revolution of the 19th-century. While simple technologies for textile production were imported from England at the end of the 1700s, it was the introduction of Eli Whitney\u2019s cotton gin and subsequent knitting and weaving mechanization that laid the groundwork for the transformation of the American economy. These devices helped to bring down the costs of textile production and made an array of industrially produced fabrics available to the vast majority of the American public. It also set in motion a patent frenzy that led to minor improvements on existing technologies, including this highly figural circular knitting machine model that Francis M. Comstock devised. Such knitting machines, which use multiple evenly spaced pins located around a central axis, were used to produce seamless tubes, as seen in the nylon stockings of the 20th century.",
    "label_text": "Nineteenth-century patent models served a variety of purposes, from demonstrating design and function, to inspiring inventors, to understanding what was possible. Similarly with these examples of twenty-first-century technology that make portraits, print tools, or translate hand gestures into form and mass\u2014they are statements about and visual wonders of our digital age.",
