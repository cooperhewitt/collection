Far superior to anything available at the time, his microscopes could magnify the view 250 times or more. The instrument was very basic\u2014a brass plate with a lens mounted in a tiny hole. The specimen was mounted on a sharp pin in front of the lens, and its position and focus were adjusted by turning the two screws. The entire instrument was only 7.5 to 10 cm (3\u20134 in.) long, and had to be held close to the eye; it required good lighting and great patience to use. One of Leeuwenhoek\u2019s special skills was grinding the lenses, producing superior magnification. He was one of the first scientists to observe and describe single-celled organisms, referring to them as \"little animalcules.\"",
