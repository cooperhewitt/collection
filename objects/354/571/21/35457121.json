    "gallery_text": "In 1850, German physiology professor Hermann von Helmholtz devised an eye mirror that used reflection to direct light rays from sunlight or a candle through the pupil, illuminating the back of the eye, called the fundus. A lens was added to sharpen the image. The so-called ophthalmoscope afforded observers the first opportunity to see living tissue, blood vessels and all, functioning in real time. The device\u2019s success led to many improvements on the initial design. This 1860 alteration by Richard Liebreich, a student of von Helmholtz, directed a beam of light to the back of the eye and had lenses that could flip out of the way. In Liebreich\u2019s time, a medical tool such as this added to a doctor\u2019s aura of expertise. The idea of directing light into the body along with a magnifying lens fostered the invention of endoscopes, laryngoscopes, otoscopes, and eventually the fiber optics of the 1960s.",
    "label_text": "This simple tool for looking at the fundus\u2014the back of the eye\u2014made possible the first view of living tissue in action. By adjusting the position, curvature, and power of the lenses, the user could sharpen the images. This model directed a beam of light to the fundus, and its removable lenses could be flipped out of the way.",
