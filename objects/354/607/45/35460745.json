    "gallery_text": "Dami\u00e1n Ortega\u2019s Controller of the Universe is a frozen explosion of hand tools hovering in an almost dreamlike state. These saws, planes, and axes suggest alternative ways to look at tools, in the hope that the experience will transform the visitor\u2019s own ideas about what tools are and mean. Tools can destroy as easily as they can help construct. They extend our body\u2019s abilities and come between us and our direct experience of the action. Ortega explores such dualities in Controller of the Universe. The installation appears threatening at its perimeter, but by way of a cruciform path the artist invites the visitor to experience the optimal viewpoint at the center. The placement of the piece in the exhibition\u2014on axis with \"live\" images of a pulsating Sun that is part of a separate installation\u2014underscores this perceived control of our universe, while the distant ball of fire reminds us so potently that this is far from the truth. We can tame it at times, use it to help us survive and endure and to enhance our lives in many ways, but we will never control it\u2014even with a world of tools at our fingertips.",

In their hovering and dreamlike state, the saws, planes, and axes are completely removed from their normal contexts, suggesting alternative ways to consider them. The artist invites us to experience the optimal viewing point at the center, where a world of tools and possibilities are at our fingertips.",
