    "gallery_text": "With the Encyclop\u00e9die, French philosopher Denis Diderot\u2019s ambition was to gather all human knowledge into a single work. While not quite that vast in scope, Diderot brought together over 100 contributors, including physicians, scientists, artisans, and scholars like Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire. He ultimately published 17 volumes of text between 1751 and 1765. The Encyclop\u00e9die is a product of its time, the Age of Enlightenment, as it exposed people to new ideas on such subjects as the rights of individuals, as well as craft production and the \"mechanical arts.\" In documenting these craft processes, Diderot aimed to reach a wide audience, urging innovation in production methods, and, controversially, revealing trade secrets of manufacturing and handicraft practices by systematically describing and illustrating every detail. The Encyclop\u00e9die was unquestionably a landmark publication, its popularity attesting to the fervor of an emerging enlightened society seeking reform, later manifested in the French Revolution.",
    "label_text": "Diderot\u2019s intent with the Encyclop\u00e9die was to gather all human knowledge into a single work. A primary focus was to document and illustrate the mechanical arts, materials, and processes. Because the illustrations drew directly from the workshops, it was, and remains, a unique compendium of the tools available in mid-18th-century Europe.",
