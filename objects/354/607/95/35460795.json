    "description": "Red silicone rubber body comprising long cylindrical handle with horizontal striations and broad cylindrical suction-cup like lamp with small circular lens in center, covering LED light source.",
    "justification": "The Praxis Grip flashlight, designed by Alexander Taylor, was released in September, 2012, and made its debut in a bold red version at the Conran Shop\u2019s RED exhibition during the London Design Festival. Taylor designed this LED flashlight in response to the rubber material brief of the first Praxis collection. \nThe Grip flashlight utilizes silicone rubber, which has many advantages over conventional plant-based rubber: silicone rubber is resistant to extreme temperatures, has excellent tensile and tear strength, and is inert, which means it does not react with most chemicals or other materials. Accordingly, it is used in many food preparation and medical applications, and for medical implants. \nTaylor employs a considered and intelligent approach to design. For this utilitarian flashlight, he drew inspiration from the form of a simple cylindrical BMX (bicycle motocross) handlebar grip. The flashlight\u2019s textured soft rubber handle is comfortable to grasp and hold. The narrow cylindrical form leads directly to a broad conical rubber head that surrounds a bright central LED light source behind a small lens. In addition to protecting the lens, the soft rubber head acts like a suction cup and can stick to any horizontal or vertical surface. The light is turned on and off via a push button in the flat end of the handle. In addition to red, Praxis produces the Grip in four colors\u2014blue, yellow, black, and white.\nThe Grip flashlight would be the first 21st-century design added to the museum\u2019s collection of flashlights. The collection\u2019s holdings characterize changes in 20th-century lighting technology, from incandescent to halogen bulbs, in metal and plastic housings designed to be useful in a variety of settings, including emergency situations. The Grip flashlight represents some of the latest developments in lighting and materials technologies, and would be a welcome addition to the collection.",

Praxis produces the Grip in red and three other bright colors\u2014blue, yellow, and white\u2014making it easy to find in any setting.",
