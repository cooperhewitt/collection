    "description": "In the form of an Italian Renaissance octagonal chapel with domed roof above two stories of windows within pediments on columns.",
    "justification": "This extraordinary model of a temple is close to many late Renaissance examples. The proportions are those of the late 16th century. The model was executed, however, in 1782, probably in Venice. It is dedicated to Pope Pius VI as a special commission. The very sophisticated carved and veneered ivory on wood demonstrates excellent skill. The structure carries its hexagonal shape from the base up to the gallery and on to the drum that supports the dome, which has oculi windows. Made by a great model maker who was possibly also an architect, this model sums up many treatises on architectural refinement of the Renaissance in its execution, shape and design.\nThis model is one of a group of models proposed for acquisition. Models are an important part of the design process, and demonstrate craftsmanship, skill of execution, and the innovative use of materials. The group under consideration would provide the museum with an opportunity to examine the role of the model in many contexts.",
    "gallery_text": "This very skilled model probably represents a 16th-century baptistery in the manner of architect Andrea Palladio. A Latin inscription on the steps reveals the maker to be the priest of a church in Cavarzere, in Italy\u2019s Veneto region. The priest recounts that it took three years of \u201cvery hard work\u201d to create the model. He presented the model to Pope Pius VI in 1782, when the Pope stopped to cross the river Adige by boat at the nearby town of Anguillara Veneta. The Pope so admired the model that he blessed the priest three times and gave him \u201cspiritual rewards\u201d; the priest apparently kept the model and inscribed it with his record of the event.\nInscription for Architectural Model of a Baptistery or ChurchA.
