    "justification": "This is one of three USB flash drives designed by 5.5 Designers and manufactured by LaCie in 2009. The family of drives takes a playful approach to the design of a technological object. \nThe USB flash drive (also known as a thumb drive, jump drive, key drive, or memory stick) is a miniature, portable data storage device that includes a flash memory with an integrated Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface for use with computers and other devices. The USB flash drive was invented in 1999 and became commercially available in 2000. As of 2012, the technology has advanced to the point where these small units can hold many gigabytes of data and have almost completely replaced the once-ubiquitous computer disc as a means of storing and transferring data. These digital tools are routinely relied upon to save and transport information, including documents, images, and medical data. \nUnlike many flash drive designs that are often characterized by bulky or elaborate \"high tech\" housings, 5.5 Designers chose to produce flash drives that look and feel like actual keys, pierced to fit on a key ring. The humor in the play on words and object form is taken a step further in the names for the different models: iamaKey, CooKey, and itsaKey. Each form, made of sturdy aluminum, is a distinct shape and has a different amount of memory and security features. In a play on the association of keys with security, LaCie refers to these USB flash drives as \u201cThe Key to Total Security\u201d because the USB connectors are both water- and scratch-resistant and any information stored on them can be encrypted.[1] 5.5 Designers and LaCie have combined design and technology to produce witty, function-driven objects.\nThese key drives, a gift from the manufacturer, would be the first of their type to join the museum\u2019s holdings in the area of computer and digital design, a collecting area that continues to grow as innovative digital technology and design evolve. The forms also relate to the museum\u2019s large collection of historic keys and locks from the 16th through 20th centuries, which includes examples in metal and other materials produced in Europe, the United States, and Asia.\n[1] \u201cCooKey,\u201d LaCie, http:\/\/www.lacie.com\/sea\/products\/product.htm?id=10462",
    "gallery_text": "Keys come in all shapes and sizes. These keys are actually 64 GB USB (Universal Serial Bus) flash drives, also known as thumb drives or memory sticks. Buried within each of these key-shaped examples is a microprocessor the size of a fingernail that carries the equivalent of thousands of photographs.  As a metaphor for unlocking knowledge, these keys can be personalized with whatever information the user chooses to store on it. We marvel at the benevolent attributes of these miniature storage devices, but, precisely because they are so small and portable, flash drives can have more sinister applications, such as cyberespionage.",
