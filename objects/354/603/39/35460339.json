    "gallery_text": "The patent for John Graham\u2019s combination tool listed several carpentry tools including a bevel, marker, gauge, try square, and level\u2014what Graham described as an \"indicator.\" When the square was placed upon a surface, the indicator pointed vertically to twelve o\u2019clock if the surface was level, varying to the left or right if not. The indicator was Graham\u2019s main invention in his patent, but he also claimed \"the combination of one or more supplemental movable or adjustable squares, with a try-square.\" This claim made Graham\u2019s invention a multitool, a carpenter\u2019s Swiss-Army knife of bevels, levels, and squares.",
