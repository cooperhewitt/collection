    "justification": "\nThe radio is the first and oldest product in the Sony&amp;nbsp;electronics range, and helped the company to achieve international acclaim. Over time,&amp;nbsp;Sony&amp;nbsp;miniaturized and simplified&amp;nbsp;its radio designs, offering them in&amp;nbsp;fewer case colors&amp;nbsp;and with less decoration. The TR-620, introduced in 1960, is a middle example of this evolution. The TR-55,&amp;nbsp;introduced in&amp;nbsp;1955, was the first of Sony\u2019s transistor radios and its first export. The TR-620\u2019s more immediate predecessor, the TR-610 of 1958, was the first radio to include the now-ubiquitous Sony logo typeface,&amp;nbsp;and with its simple rectangular design of&amp;nbsp;about 4 x&amp;nbsp;2 \u00bd x 1&amp;nbsp;inches, it was the smallest and lightest AM radio at the time. Sony sold half a million TR-610 sets worldwide between 1958 and 1960. \nThe TR-620 was smaller yet. Easily able to fit into a purse or pocket, it appealed to the burgeoning demand for increasingly diminutive and portable personal electronics. It also had a slightly larger station read-out than the TR-610, and the rectangular form was dominated by&amp;nbsp;a gold-toned pierced circular metal speaker with a simple recessed asterisk-like design.&amp;nbsp;The radio&amp;nbsp;was available in several colors, including white, blue, and red, and came with an earphone and black faux leather case&amp;nbsp;as well. The TR-620 was Sony's last transistor radio with&amp;nbsp;a speaker&amp;nbsp;marketed as a shirt-pocket radio.&amp;nbsp; By the mid-1960s, Sony engineers further reduced the radio's size by eliminating the speaker to create an earphone-only radio, which also allowed for cheaper transistors to be used.\n",
