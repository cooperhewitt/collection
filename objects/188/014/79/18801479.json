    "justification": "The two projects were executed by Viollet-Le-Duc-for his friend publisher P.J. Hetzel who had purchased a small house in the country and commissioned Viollet-le-Duc to design additions to it. The final design which was executed incorporates ideas from both these drawings. The house still exists in Bellevue which is near Paris.\nThese drawings also are propozed to fill the large gap, in the drawings collection of late nineteenth century architectural drawings. As Viollet-le-Duc was an enonlously influential and important figure of his time it seems extremely appropriate to me to add these examples of his work.",
