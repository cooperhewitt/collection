    "description": "Stomacher with a slightly u-shaped upper edge; the bottom finishes in a point with three independent tabs on either side. The front is linen, almost entirely covered with couched silver metallic yarns; while the metallic yarns are laid on horizontally, the couching stitches follow a \"V\" pattern. In the center is a single rose tied with a bow. The rose was made separately from red and green silk and gold metallic yarn in a needle lace technique; it is sewn on top of the silver couching.  The center panel is trimmed with white silk piping and a narrow woven metal ribbon; eight green silk tabs project from the sides for pinning the stomacher in place. Stiffened with ribs of an unidentified material, and lined with block printed linen with a pattern of small birds in a scrolling vine in red on white.",

    "gallery_text": "This woman\u2019s stomacher is nearly covered in rich silver metallic thread embroidery. At the top is a red and white rose tied with a bow, possibly a Tudor Rose, heraldic symbol of England. Worn with an open robe, it covered the V-shaped opening by pinning or stitching the green tabs to keep it in place, a time-consuming process. Silver threads were laid horizontally over the stomacher, and a series of stepped couching stitches secured the metal threads to the linen foundation while creating a surface pattern. The central panel terminates at the bottom in an arrowhead shape while three tabs lie on either side of it \u2013 a remnant from late 17th century fashion. Stomachers often were made in colors or patterns that contrasted with that of open robe, serving more as an accessory. In this case, silver embroidery made the stomacher easily interchangeable with other robes and functioned much like jewelry.",
