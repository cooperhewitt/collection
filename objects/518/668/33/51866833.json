He observed that rectangular thermostats often sit crooked on the wall; a round device would be easier to install properly. The Honeywell Round, released a decade later, allows users to adjust temperature with a simple twist of the dial. Dreyfuss\u2019s design also promoted customization: users could remove the protective cover and paint the device to match the room. Today, the Honeywell Round remains one of the world\u2019s most ubiquitous thermostats.",
