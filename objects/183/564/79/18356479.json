The diameter of the lid corresponds to that of the front.  In front, cornices of a broken pediment from which festoons hang toward the gaines. At the ends of the cornices sit two angels with lily stems. They lean upon the round base of a statue of St. John the Baptist with shouldered cross staff.",
