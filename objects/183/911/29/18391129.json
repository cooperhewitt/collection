    "gallery_text": "In Europe and the US, middle- and upper-class women followed strict and complicated etiquette guidelines in daily life, including after a family member\u2019s death. Etiquette dictated that a survivor follow at least two phases of mourning\u2014deep followed by half, or second, mourning\u2014to publicly proclaim her grief. Deep mourning, when she was expected to seclude herself from most social gatherings and wear only dull blacks, lasted a few weeks to a year, depending on the mourner\u2019s relationship to deceased, with widows invariably mourning the longest. Women were expected to replace their ordinary goods\u2014dresses, hats, handkerchiefs, stationery, parasols, fans, and so on\u2014with specific mourning ones, always in the latest styles. Daily newspapers, fashion magazines, and etiquette books prescribed ways for women to mourn \u201cwell,\u201d fashionably yet still respectfully grief-stricken; to err in doing so was an insult to both society and the deceased. This simple fan of fragile black crepe silk\u2014an unmistakable signifier for mourning\u2014by the prestigious \u00e9vantailliste Maison Duvelleroy, was likely used in deep mourning, helping the user proclaim her grief, her role in polite society, and her fashionability.",
