    "description": "Pale blue ground with vertical series of landscapes painted in polychrome tempera. At bottom, spotted deer beneath blossoming apple tree. Next two pieces have been joined together leaving an incomplete design of breakwater with another group immediately above it. The next group shows two men talking in a field, one man holding a hoe. Man, woman and child walk toward first two. A natural rocky bridge runs to next group: a water carrier, farmer and ox on a bridge. Above bridge, a house compound beside a great rock with several figures in front of the house. At top, an incomplete group with houses under a great cliff near water. A water carrier and a man with a hoe walk toward houses. Left edge and bottom have blue and white trim",
