    "gallery_text": "These working sketches played an essential role in the collaborative design process between architect Le Corbusier and his clients, modern art collectors Michael and Sarah Stein and their friend Gabrielle de Monzie, and, significantly, led historians to question previously held assumptions about the building. The drawing reflects many changes in the design\u2019s development; the architect shifted from a symmetrical to asymmetrical plan with an extra bedroom for de Monzie\u2019s daughter, and placed the living quarters in de Monzie\u2019s section of the house with garage and kitchen near the Steins\u2019 area. These changes suggest de Monzie, whose name appears on the project contract and invoices, may have had more design control than the Steins, despite their strong interest in avant-garde architecture. The rational, geometric house was completed in 1927, and for decades scholars compared its rhythmic structural bays and volume to Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio\u2019s villas. However, when historians rediscovered this drawing in the mid-1980s, some determined instead that the house\u2019s form derived from programmatic requirements\u2014the need for a multifamily home\u2014and Le Corbusier\u2019s thinking about other commissions. Understanding the architect\u2019s process and his relationship with clients is difficult, and as shown by the scholarship around this drawing, it is also ongoing task.",
