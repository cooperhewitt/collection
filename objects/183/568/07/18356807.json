The central motif below is a circular medallion with a seated man, carried by the wings of two crouched griffins and supported by women seated upon the pointed arches. A spherical panel at left is decorated with an ovoidal medallion supported by seated women. Above is a view similar to that in -1524 with what probably means a trellis architecture in the center.",
