    "description":"Bris\u00e9 fan of carved ivory painted in oils and finished with Vernis Martin; each face has a leaf and gorge area. On the front, the leaf shows an outdoor scene with figures and houses, at left a shop or bazaar, at right figures dining. The gorge is decorated with Chinese and European motifs supporting a central cartouche over the edge of which leans a lady in 18th C. dress, while behind her can be seen the head of a gallant. On the reverse, the leaf is painted with a landscape with mounted hunters and hounds pursuing a stag. The gorge shows a central cartouche with a scene of Chinese figures. The head end of the guards is overlaid with tortoise. The guards are decorated in the scheme of the gorge, each divided into four parts and containing alternately a head or group of figures. The rivet heads are mother-of-pearl buttons. The ribbon is green silk, painted on the obverse with a geometric design in gold, red and black, and on the reverse with a similar design in gold and green.",
