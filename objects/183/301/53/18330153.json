Depicted is a right-handed glove, palm up, placed horizontally above a pair of men's knee breeches, with a very small and out of scale kneeling buck below.  This composition is placed in the center of a  Rococo-style cartouche composed of scrolls terminating in foliate ornamanent with a small blossom on either side.  The bottom of the cartouche has been cut off by the loss to the sheet, where a fragment of pen and black ink can be seen at bottom left.",
