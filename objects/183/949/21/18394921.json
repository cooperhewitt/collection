A large carved settee is placed against the back wall beneath a mirror, extending the full length of the settee, and flanked by military figures on wall brackets; in front of the settee is a table.  A corner etagere in the left rear displays glass and silver objects. A series of low side chairs with high backs are arranged at left and right. The walls are painted sky blue and the floor is of diamond-patterned marble.",
