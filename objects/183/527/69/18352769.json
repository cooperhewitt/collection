    "gallery_text": "The French artist Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer trained in Antwerp, where he perfected his skill of composing floral still life paintings, a specialty of the Low Countries. His designs combine the scientific accuracy of botanical illustration with an aesthetic elegance. Popular with aristocratic clients in France, England and the Netherlands, Monnoyer\u2019s flower paintings document the evolution of the French still life into a legitimate artistic style. Grand floral compositions came to dominate the French decorative arts, and were found on tapestries, carpets and embroidery. Monnoyer worked in a variety of media; he painted still lifes, designed schemes for interior decorations at Versailles and other French royal palaces, and was affiliated with the Gobelins and Beauvais tapestry manufactories. Prints of his floral compositions were eagerly sought by print collectors. They were also published in the form of pattern books for use by artists and designers. These greatly contributed to his popularity and renown. This engraving is a plate from the series Livres de Plusieurs Paniers de Fleurs, one of the artist\u2019s most influential suite of prints.",
