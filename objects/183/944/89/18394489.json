    "description": "Large hanging of cotton chintz, lined with pale blue Chinese silk damask (now removed), contemporary with the chintz, and bound on three sides with twill curtain binding.\nThe design is of large-scale flowering branches with large blossoms, smaller sprays of flowers, and heavily curved leaves, with birds (peacocks, parakeets, and pheasants) perched among them. With exception of certain leaves, design elements have different color scheme and internal decoration with each repetition, including all kinds of diapers, linear plant sprigs, hatching and shading, sometimes with resist. The trees spring from a rockery of Chinoiserie character, in which appear animal and human figures, including a shepherd in a pointed hat with a crook, blowing a horn to gather his sheep; a hunter with a round hat bearing a spear, while dogs below pursue a leopard; stags, goats, and rabbits.\nThe painting is elaborate, in multiple shades of red and green, with light blue, violet, and brown, and much shading, on a white ground. The men are in red, with patterning suggested on their clothes.  Animals are red with darker markings or white spots. Birds are in shades of red or green in plumage, with feather marking indicated. The hillocks in the landscape are light brown with darker brown outlines.   \nThe original glaze is intact.",
