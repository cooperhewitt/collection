    "description": "Below is a calix from which two curved rinceaux spring.  They end laterally in blossoms from which candelabra rise. They end above the head of the half-figure of a child. From the flowers and the lower scrolls of the figure hang festoons toward the candelabra. Birds are upon the upper ones from which trophies hang with implements of Cupid. Butterflies are at the ends of threads held by the birds.",
