Charles Toch\u00e9 (1851-1916)\nNotations of some in the group contain \"Bossi-Beyerlen\" codes, a system of notes, inventory numbers and prices found only in the Tiepolo drawings sold in the Bossi-Beyerlen sale in Stuttgart in 1882. These inscriptions have been identified as by Dominico Tiepolo. \nThis evidence suggests that the Hewitt Album is Domenico's own collection of the family etchings.",
