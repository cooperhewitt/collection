    "gallery_text": "The words \"Man\u2019f Company Lambertville Goodyear Patent,\" stamped in tiny letters on the handle of this fan provide the key to its material. The Lambertville Manufacturing Company was active in the 1860s in the manufacture of vulcanized rubber. Natural rubber, tapped from tropical trees, is a \"plastic\" polymer material, which can be formed or molded, but in its natural state it is sticky, odiferous, and perishable. It does not hold its shape when exposed to heat, and becomes brittle when exposed to cold. In the vulcanization process, natural rubber is heated with sulfur, making it harder and less susceptible to temperature changes. \nVarious patents for vulcanized rubber were granted to Charles Goodyear and his brother between 1839 and 1860, transforming rubber from an impractical manufacturing material to a vastly important resource used to manufacture tires. The fan functions beautifully as a promotional souvenir commemorating one of Goodyear\u2019s patents, showcasing its improved properties.",
    "label_text": "Vulcanization, a process developed in the 19th century to improve the working qualities of natural rubber, produced a material stiff enough to be drilled into this open decorative pattern. The rubber was also heat-molded to create the raised ornament on the handle, which is stamped \u201cLambertville Goodyear Patent.\u201d",
