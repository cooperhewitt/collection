    "description": "Large bedcover of white satin embroidered in allover floral pattern in brilliant colored silks and metallic thread. Design, symmetrically arranged, shows curving vines, flowerheads both flat and in profile, around a large cental motif of a series of half circle and petal-shaped forms. Brilliant long tailed birds in foliage; a wide border of vine and flower design. The work is in long floating stitches of silk thread couched down with metal or silk; each element edged with gold thread, which appears to be gilded paper around a silk core. Stems of gold thread couched down. Cover consists of four pieces of silk and is lined with thin, faded pink Chinese silk in a geometric design.",
