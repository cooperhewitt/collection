    "justification": "Cooper Hewitt's extensive collection of irons represents a major portion of its industrial design collection. Not only do they connect , through their function, product design with the world of textiles, the advancement of the design relates to the technological possibilities of Pyrex glass. The metal shortages of World War II led to experiments with other materials, including Pyrex. Known to resist high heat since 1915, Pyrex was an excellent material for handles, to stay comfortable to the touch, and be comfortable when used. It could be molded to conform to the grip of the hand, an early example of ergonomics. The use of bright color, probably related to \"fun\"-bright red as well as the blue seen here created a distinctive look that turned out to be vulnerable to changes in taste, and the iron had a short-lived production. This streamlined and ergonomic model shows the post-war era concentration on enhancing designs for domestic life.",
