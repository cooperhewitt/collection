The other designs in the series include Rocaille (Rococo Motifs); Hommage Champ\u00eatre (Pastorale); and L\u00e9da, all etched by Claude Duflos; and Triomphe de Pomone (Triumph of Pomona) etched by Charles Nicolas Cochin the Younger. Shell motif at top. Three putti grasping at berries in the upper portion of the design, to the right of a herm in the personification of Priapus, protector of orchards and gardens, which is at left. Cypress trees at right. Two putti pulling a goat on top of stairs and other putti both helping with the goat and holding berries. Panel framed with leaves, branches and berries.",

    "gallery_text": "This etching  is a design for a panel for a folding screen titled, \u201cThe Triumph of Priapus.\u201d It was etched and engraved as part of a five-plate suite of folding screen designs. The composition is anchored by two flights of stairs leading into an Italian garden populated with cypress trees. Putti fly across the landscape holding an overflowing cornucopia and some play with the goat in the garden. On the balustrade, a pair of putti plays with flowers and berries. This energetic scene is overseen by a term with a satyr head that serves as a stand-in for Priapus, the Greek god of the vegetable garden, goats, bees and virility. In this design, Boucher references the fact that Priapus was worshipped on fields where goats and sheep pastured. This design is a prime example of Boucher\u2019s artistic vocabulary as it combines allegorical iconography and rustic themes. While folding screens based on his designs were probably never realized, Boucher along with artists such as Antoine Watteau, Claude Audran, Jacques de Lajo\u00fce, and Nicolas Lancret designed panels for folding screens, particularly as screens became a ubiquitous part of French interior furnishings from the late seventeenth-century onwards.",
