    "description": "One of five panel designs for a folding screen. The other designs in the series include Rocaille (Rococo Motifs) etched by Charles Nicolas Cochin ; and Hommage Champ\u00eatre (Pastorale); L\u00e9da; and Triomphe de Priape (Triumph of Priapus) all etched by Claude Duflos the Younger. This panel design depicts Pomona, a nymph who adored her fruit trees and gardens, two young companions, a male and a female, and a rustic building in the background. Below, a cartouche decorated with fruits and leaves, the interior decorated with a circular courtyard, a fountain and grotesque mask.",

    "gallery_text": "This design for a folding screen panel represents the allegory of Pomona, the Roman goddess of orchard fruits. It was etched and engraved as part of a series of folding screen designs. Boucher\u2019s composition can be divided into three parts. The lower section shows a circular courtyard and a design for a fountain bordered by a shell-covered grotto with a grotesque mask. This serves as a pedestal upon which a shepherd, shepherdesses and donkey are arranged in picturesque composition in a bucolic setting that is filled with overflowing baskets of orchard fruits. In the background is a rustic landscape, complete with a cottage and a well. Leaves and vines frame the design, and the overall composition is a microcosm of the pastoral genre favored by Boucher. In this case, the pastorale has merged with the genre of mythological allegory and Boucher\u2019s propensity for rococo iconography (in the manner of Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier) to produce a wholly ornamental composition. While this design probably was not realized, Boucher follows the example of artists such as Antoine Watteau, Claude Audran, Jacques de Lajo\u00fce, and Nicolas Lancret who designed folding screens, as the latter became a ubiquitous part of French interior furnishings from the late seventeenth-century onwards.",
