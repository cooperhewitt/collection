    "description": "Two designs epitomizing the fantastical asymmetric rococo spirit, possibly to be produced in gold or silver. At left, a vase-like form decorated with shell motifs, acanthus leaves and c- and s-scrolls. At right, an ewer form decorated with shell, leave and c- and s-scrolls. Two auricular fragments are placed between the two objects.",

    "gallery_text": "This print illustrates the fantastical ornamentation characteristic of German rococo. During the last quarter of the eighteenth century, designers competed to invent ornaments of bizarre imagination. By printing their designs for decorative arts, an artist could advertise their creativity and attract commissions from clients. The portability of pattern books helped spread the French rococo style internationally. Designs were widely copied and sold among craftsmen working in precious metals. The sculptor and printmaker Franz Xaver Haberman worked in Augsburg, the most important German market for gold and silver. He turned to publishing his designs when commissions for wood sculptural decorations became scarce. Between 500 and 600 of his ornament designs were printed by the Augsburg publishers Johann Georg Hertel and Martin Engelbrecht. Habermann displays his training as a sculptor in this sheet of printed designs for ewer-shaped ornaments, incorporating cartouches, shell motifs, acanthus leaves and C-scrolls. Two auricular fragments could be applied as designs for wall decorations or furniture embellishments. These flamboyant forms would have enabled a silversmith or wood carver to demonstrate his talent for replicating rococo ornament.",
    "label_text": "In 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
