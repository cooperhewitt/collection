At the back of the coach, where the driver would presumably sit, a crown and possibly a riding crop are set upon a cushion.  At the front of the coach, there are various household objects like a lamp and ornate, framed mirror.  The carriage's door has a screen-like window, and below this, a framed pastoral scene.",
