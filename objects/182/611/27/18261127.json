    "gallery_text": "This etching for the upper part of a clock features a caryatid beating upon a pair of drums, alluding to the rhythm of the clock\u2019s mechanism. The margins of the sheet are filled with alternative designs for clock faces and other ornaments. The design could have been executed in polychrome wood marquetry or with a tortoiseshell and brass veneer in the style of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle.\nThe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the proliferation of ornament prints, a useful resource for artisans wanting to stay current with the latest design trends. Daniel Marot produced a vast number of prints, having learned the technique of etching from his father. As court artist to William III of Orange, Marot was the central figure in the creation of the William and Mary style, the Anglo-Dutch expression of courtly Baroque style. He was among the Huguenots who fled France and took refuge in Holland following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The migration of Protestants helped to disseminate the French style internationally. The dense profusion of ornament in this design closely resembles the work of the French court artist Jean Berain, particularly in the flat, interlacing band work enlivened by classicizing swags and urn forms.",
    "label_text": "The 17th and 18th centuries saw a proliferation of ornament prints, popular sources of patterns among artisans who circulated designs across long distances. Marot, a Huguenot expatriate to the Netherlands and court artist to William III of Orange, was a central figure in the creation of the William and Mary style.\nIn 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
