    "description":"Elaborate rocaille frame willed with C-scrolls and interlace patterns with large upper central vignette and smaller scene in lower center of frame.  The upper scene shows the interior of the blacksmith's shop.  Lamour is presenting for Stanislas's inspection a pilaster being executed after the drawing on the table before them.  A huge archway that will span one of the fountains rests behind them.  The blacksmith wears the wig and attire of a gentleman, appropriate to his role as the entrepreneur, designer, and engineer who realized the ironwork decoration of the Nancy town square.  In the lower scene, three putti with wings play (one of them is forging a piece of ironwork) in a basement shop.",
