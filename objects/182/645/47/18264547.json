It is published as plate 55 in Recueil de decorations int\u00e9rieures (Collection of Interior Decorations) an ornament publication produced by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine (1762\u20131853), Napoleon\u2019s chief architect, and his partner, Charles Percier (1764-1838). Percier and Fontaine are credited with disseminating the Empire style during the Napoleonic era, and advising the First Consul on architecture, design, and urban planning. Percier and Fontaine\u2019s etching offers a composite view that fuses the rendering of the military tent themed Council chamber with warlike trophies and fantastical helmet designs. Minerva clade in her armor, interlocking spears, and fasces, (rods carried by ancient Roman lictors as a symbol of justice) reinforcing the military theme. The tented interior and the war-themed decorations are reflections of the Napoleonic military moment. Percier and Fontaine claimed that this particular room was built in ten days, in order not to disrupt Bonaparte\u2019s frequent journeys.",
