    "gallery_text": "Made in Space and NASA partnered to launch the \"3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment\"\u2014or, \"the flying factory\"\u2014on September 23, 2014. Three-D printers use an additive extrusion-based process to build objects layer by layer out of polymers, composites, and other materials. Thus far, all space missions have been completely dependent on Earth for equipment, but as missions get longer and further from Earth, the more difficult it is to resupply materials. The current supply chain from Earth to space can be largely bypassed with 3D printers, with astronauts able to create the parts they need, including common instruments and replacement parts. Made in Space\u2019s 3D printer has generated a selection of ABS-plastic test parts such as these examples. Once the printer is operable on the International Space Station, the printed parts will be the the very first objects to be manufactured off planet Earth.",
    "label_text": "Space missions depend on equipment sent from Earth, but if astronauts can make parts as needed, the supply chain from Earth to space could be largely bypassed. A 3D printer like this, designed for use in microgravity, was sent to the International Space Station (ISS), where it is making the very first objects manufactured off planet Earth.\n\nA copy of this plaque is installed inside the Made In Space 3D printer on the ISS. The logo shows a digital stream of information being broadcast from California to the ISS, demonstrating how digital signals will translate into functional tools off Earth.",
