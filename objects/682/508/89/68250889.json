Pivot Power Genius is an app-enabled version of Zien\u2019s original power strip, which bends to fit various plugs and adapters. This version allows users to control two outlets from a mobile device.\nQuirky designs and manufactures real people\u2019s inventions by inviting the public to submit and participate in the development process. At meetings held online and in person at Quirky\u2019s headquarters in New York City, members gather to evaluate ideas. Quirky\u2019s designers, engineers, and marketing experts work closely with the community on nearly all aspects of development to bring approved ideas to life. Each Quirky product is a direct response to an everyday problem.",
