Richardson experimented with recycled bottles and 3D printing before hitting on bamboo, a material that is strong, light, cheap, and locally grown. An adjustable cuff connects to various tools, including a rake, broom, and shovel. A canvas sleeve reinforced with bamboo ribs secures the prosthetic to the user\u2019s amputation limb.",
