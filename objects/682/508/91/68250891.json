    "description": "Hanging lamp in the form of a large clear glass incandescent light bulb, the globe surrounded by a transluscent white plastic band from which project eight colorful, realistic figures of winged insects seemingly in flight around the bulb; halogen light source suspended from brass fitting in center of bulb-shaped globe.",
    "justification": "Ingo Maurer is one of the most creative and respected lighting designers working today. Since the 1960s, he has been a pioneer in the use of new lighting technologies and imaginative production techniques to investigate the \"magical and mystical\" qualities of light. The J. B. Schmetterling (butterfly in German) lamp explores this concept by infusing a simple light bulb with a poetic consideration of themes like nature and attraction. \nThis hanging lamp is based on the light bulb form of his 2002 design, the Johnny B. Good lamp. In this variation, Maurer has added eight highly realistic replicas of flying insects. Colorful iridescent butterflies, moths, and dragonflies attached to long pins are applied to the simple translucent band around the bulb. The scene appears to be a moment frozen in time, as captivated insects hover around the lamp's bright, dangerously hot light. To achieve this design, Maurer collaborated with Axel Schmid, a longstanding member of his design team, and worked with American nature photographer and artist, Graham Owen, who specializes in handmade life-like fishing lures and artificial insects for moviemakers. The lamp is an unusual combination of industrial and artisanal techniques, resulting in a functional form that allows the user to bring a sense of nature to an indoor environment. The form invites one to contemplate the beauty of nature, the beauty of light, and\u2014on an existential level\u2014the nature of attraction and compulsion.\nGiven Maurer\u2019s creativity and innovations in the area of lighting, he is a designer the museum\u2019s curators continue to follow. At the time of proposed acquisition, the museum holds a group a Maurer designs that have allowed us to trace his work from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s. The addition of the J.B. Schmetterling lamp would bring the museum\u2019s collection of his work into the 21st century.",
