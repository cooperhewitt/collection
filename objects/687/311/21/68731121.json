    "description": "Square-cropped views of five black Playboy Bunny heads, rotated at different angles. Flyer title (Playboy Architecture 1953-1979) is printed in pink at top. Beneath the bunnies, columns of text are printed in small black type. Poster advertises exhibition held at NAiM \/ Bureau Europa.",
    "justification": "In 2012, the design team Experimental Jetset created the graphic identity for the exhibition \u201cPlayboy Architecture, 1952-1979\u201d at NAiM \/ Bureau Europa, an architecture institute in Maastricht, The Netherlands.  The exhibition looked at influence of Playboy Magazine on architecture and design, and was curated by the M+M (Media and Modernity) Program at the Princeton University School of Architecture.  Experimental Jetset took the iconic bunny logo of Playboy and cropped and rotated it, creating a \u201cmulti-eyed entity\u201d that alluded to the exhibitions themes.  The designers chose to print some of the text in pink, a reference to the \u201cnotion of flesh,\u201d but also \u201can attempt to somewhat undermine the \u2018machismo\u2019 of the subject of the exhibition.  After all,\u201d the designers have noted, \u201cpink is often seen as an effeminate colour.\u201d  The design was altered to suit three different formats: a large, poster screenprinted by Wyber Zeefdruk was used to advertise the exhibition outdoors.  A smaller poster, offset-printed by Lenoirschuring, advertised the exhibition indoors.  A folder pamphlet served as an invitation.",
