    "description": "A black square subdivided into quadrants resembles a floorplan, with three door openings. \"The Art of Inhabitation\" is printed in the square, with one word per quadrant, in a counter-clockwise progression from the top right to the bottom right. \"Inhabitation\" is broken into three lines. Above the square, \"Alison & Peter Smithson:\" is printed in gray text on white ground.  The poster advertises an exhibition at NAiM \/ Bureau Europa.",
    "justification": "Since 2007, Experimental Jetset has created the graphic identity for NAiM \/ Bureau Europa, an architecture institute in Maastricht, The Netherlands.  (In 2013, the organization changed its name to Bureau Europa).  In 2011, They were asked to design the promotional materials for the exhibition \u201cAlison & Peter Smithson: The Art of Inhabitation.\u201d  For the exhibition identity, the designers chose to reference the influential 1956 exhibition \u201cThis is Tomorrow,\u201d which was held at Whitechapel Gallery in London and had included work by the Smithsons.  The catalogue for \u201cThis is Tomorrow,\u201d designed by Edward Wright (British, 1912\u201388), had featured a floor plan at each chapter break.  Experimental Jetset\u2019s design featured a four-room floor plan.  In each \u201croom\u201d the designers place one word of the exhibition\u2019s subtitle.  The layout of the floor plan, with its doorways, entrances, and exists, guides the reader as to how to read the text, \u201cThe Art of Inhabitation.\u201d  But the designers appreciated that the layout allowed for the viewers to see the echoes of an alternate reading, \u201cThe Inhabitation of Art.\u201d  The poster, screenprinted by Wyber Zeefdruk, was used to advertise the exhibition outdoors throughout the city.",
