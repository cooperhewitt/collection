    "justification": "Jianping He was among forty Asian designers invited by the Taiwanese calligrapher Tong Yang-Tze to collaborate on a group of twenty-four works of calligraphy focusing on the subject of \"imitating nature.\" The theme, which had long been a driving influence in the tradition of Chinese painting and calligraphy, also reminded He of a quote by Albert Einstein: \"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.\" Working with Yang-Tze, He designed a poster that features a single calligraphic Chinese character. He built-up a network of thin lines that connect the different ends of the character\u2019s lines, transforming the flat design into a shape with a three-dimensional appearance.  The poster was designed for the Asian Culture and Arts Development Alliance.",
