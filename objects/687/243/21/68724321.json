    "description": "Film poster divided diagonally into yellow and black sections. The yellow section (lower left) resembles a staircase, which two small figures in cowboy hats appear to climb. Towering over them, a large man in waistcoat stands at the foot of this staircase, checking his pocketwatch. He occupies most of the black section. Above him to the left, the film title is printed in white Cyrillic letters.",
    "justification": "This poster advertises a Soviet film from 1929, The Ghost That Isn\u2019t Returning, directed by Abram Room. Room is best known for directing Bed and Sofa, a 1927 film for which the Stenberg brothers designed one of their most iconic posters. The Ghost That Isn\u2019t Returning follows Jose Real, a South American oilfield worker sentenced to life in prison for protesting his country\u2019s totalitarian regime. After he instigates rebellion among his fellow prisoners, the guards grant him a one-day furlough, during which they plan to assassinate him. An agent tracks Real across the desert, as he unites with his family and plots another prison revolt. The poster depicts this chase. To the left, the agent follows Real up a yellow staircase, evocative of the vast desert landscape where Real struggles to evade him. On the right, the agent towers over the scene, checking his watch and waiting to catch Real in a trap. The chase unfolds over many scenes, but the poster\u2019s composition is inspired by a specific moment in the film, when the agent walks down a long dirt road, streaked with the shadows of fence posts. The Stenberg brothers have cleverly transformed the scene, converting the shadows into the steps of a staircase. Their design captures the suspense of pursuit, heightened by sharp angles and contrasting colors.",
