    "gallery_text": "Embroidered textiles from the Greek Islands have a striking diversity that shows various regional influences including Venetian and Turkish silks and the decorative motifs found on pottery and tiles. Thasos, in the northern Aegean Sea, is one of the Sporades Islands and is closest to Thrace in northeastern Greece. Because of its isolation from the other Greek islands and close proximity to the Ottoman Empire, a Turkish influence can be seen in the embroidered patterns. Much that remains of the textiles from Thasos seems limited to long, rectangular cushion covers with geometric patterns that include intersecting triangles and diamond shapes with saw tooth borders. Embroidered using a counted running stitch, the maker of this piece alternated the direction of stitches causing them to reflect the light differently, giving the illusion of three-dimensional space.",
