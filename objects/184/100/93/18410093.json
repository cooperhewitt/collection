    "justification": "In 1953, Dan Fuller, president of Fuller Fabrics, invited five of the 20th century\u2019s most distinguished artists: Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Marc Chagall, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Raoul Dufy, to collaborate on a line of textiles to be called the Modern Master Series. The concept was unique in that the artists were not commissioned to produce original patterns specifically for the textiles. Instead, Fuller worked with each artist to select motifs from their existing body of work, which were then translated by the company\u2019s in house designers into repeating patterns.[1] Fidelity of reproduction was essential, and Fuller\u2019s designers worked diligently to render the motifs accurately for engraving. The patterns were roller printed rather than screen printed, because the fabric was intended to be mass produced and sold at low price points\u2014less than $2 a yard\u2014for use by both garment manufacturers and home sewers. Each artist approved the final patterns derived from his work and was involved in the selection of the colors. \nMarketing was a key element of the project. The Modern Master Series was launched in the fall of 1955 with both a museum exhibition as well as a documentary film that featured the artists in their studios, the original works of art, the finished fabrics, and the production process. The exhibition and film opened at the Brooklyn Museum and then traveled to other American museums.[2] For a five-page editorial spread in Life magazine, \u201cModern Art in Fashion,\u201d Life\u2019s fashion editor, Sally Kirkland, enlisted the participation of her friend, fashion designer Claire McCardell. McCardell designed a wardrobe of separates and dresses using Modern Master fabrics, which were featured in the Life photo essay.[3]\nThe collection of 60 designs was much celebrated when it was launched. American Fabrics applauded Fuller for its daring and courage in bridging \u201cthe abyss\u201d between fine and applied arts.[4] At the time of acquisition, the museum holds six other fabrics from Fuller\u2019s Modern Master Series in its collection: The Bullfight, Birds, and Poisson by Picasso; Vitrail by L\u00e9ger; Femme Ecoutant by Mir\u00f3; and Evening Enchantment by Chagall. \nIn 1951, Fernand L\u00e9ger designed 17 monumental stained glass windows (vitrail, in French) depicting the Instruments of Christ\u2019s Passion for the new Eglise du Sacr\u00e9 Coeur in Audincourt, France. The design for one of these windows, which featured pincers and nails, was used as the pattern for Vitrail. Catholic church windows seem an unlikely design source for a fashion fabric; one garment manufacturer used Vitrail for drip-dry cotton bathing suits, in a colorway of deep pinks. L\u00e9ger was not a religious man, however. His goal in designing the Audincourt church windows was to create something that was objectively beautiful, not \u201csentimental.\u201d His choice of the pincers and nails motif for Fuller\u2019s Modern Master Series seems to underscore the intent of his original window designs: to \u201cproduce a pattern of forms and colors that was relevant to all, believers and non believers alike.\u201d[5]\n\n[1] Geoffrey Rayner, Richard Chamberlain and Annamarie Stapleton, Artists\u2019 Textiles: Artist Designed Textiles 1940\u20131976 (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors\u2019 Club, 2012), 139.\n[2] \"Trying abstraction on fabrics; adaptations from Picasso, Miro, and L\u00e9ger.\" Artnews 54, (November 1955): 43.\n[3] Kohle Yohannan, and Nancy Nolf, Claire McCardell: Redefining Modernism (New York: Harry N.

In 1955, he used the design for one of these windows, Pincers and Nails, as the pattern for Vitrail, a textile produced as part of Fuller Fabric\u2019s \u201cModern Masters Series.\u201d \n \nL\u00e9ger was one of five artists commissioned by the American manufacturer to design textiles; the others were Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Joan Miro, and Raoul Dufy.
