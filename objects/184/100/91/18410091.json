    "justification": "In 1953, Dan Fuller, president of Fuller Fabrics, invited five of the 20th century\u2019s most distinguished artists: Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Marc Chagall, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Raoul Dufy, to collaborate on a line of textiles to be called the Modern Master Series. The concept was unique in that the artists were not commissioned to produce original patterns specifically for the textiles. Instead, Fuller worked with each artist to select motifs from their existing body of work, which were then translated by the company\u2019s in house designers into repeating patterns.[1] Fidelity of reproduction was essential, and Fuller\u2019s designers worked diligently to render the motifs accurately for engraving. The patterns were roller printed rather than screen printed, because the fabric was intended to be mass produced and sold at low price points\u2014less than $2 a yard\u2014for use by both garment manufacturers and home sewers. Each artist approved the final patterns derived from his work and was involved in the selection of the colors. \nMarketing was a key element of the project. The Modern Master Series was launched in the fall of 1955 with both a museum exhibition as well as a documentary film that featured the artists in their studios, the original works of art, the finished fabrics, and the production process. The exhibition and film opened at the Brooklyn Museum and then traveled to other American museums.[2] For a five page editorial spread in Life magazine, \u201cModern Art in Fashion,\u201d Life\u2019s fashion editor, Sally Kirkland, enlisted the participation of her friend, fashion designer Claire McCardell. McCardell designed a wardrobe of separates and dresses using Modern Master fabrics, which were featured in the Life photo essay.[3]\nThe collection of 60 designs was much celebrated when it was launched. American Fabrics applauded Fuller for its daring and courage in bridging \u201cthe abyss\u201d between fine and applied arts.[4] At the time of proposed acquisition, the museum holds six other fabrics from Fuller\u2019s Modern Master Series in its collection: The Bullfight, Birds, and Poisson by Picasso; Vitrail by L\u00e9ger; Femme Ecoutant by Mir\u00f3; and Evening Enchantment by Chagall. \nThe source motif for this fabric comes from a magical painting, Evening Enchantment, by one of the most original of the giants of 20th-century art, Marc Chagall. In creating this pattern, Fuller captured the essence of Chagall\u2019s work: its lush, lyrical colors and mystical, dreamlike quality. This sumptuous overall pattern in rich blues and greens, features a violinist surrounded by a fantasy world of flowers. The violinist was a frequent symbol in Chagall\u2019s work, one that recalled his Jewish upbringing in Russia. Flowers, an expression of love, were another recurring symbol. Chagall\u2019s romanticized, luxurious rendering of these images created a particularly elegant fabric. \nClaire McCardell (1905\u20131958), who is acknowledged with creating \u201cThe American Look\u201d in women\u2019s leisurewear, used Evening Enchantment as the fabric for a handsome full skirted dress. While the fabrics from Fuller\u2019s Modern Master Series were generally used for casual sportswear, the elegance of this print gives McCardell\u2019s dress a more formal and sophisticated allure. \n[1] Geoffrey Rayner, Richard Chamberlain and Annamarie Stapleton, Artists\u2019 Textiles: Artist Designed Textiles 1940\u20131976 (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors\u2019 Club, 2012), 139.\n[2] \"Trying abstraction on fabrics; adaptations from Picasso, Miro, and L\u00e9ger.\" Artnews 54, (November 1955): 43.\n[3] Kohle Yohannan, and Nancy Nolf, Claire McCardell: Redefining Modernism (New York: Harry N.
