    "gallery_text": "Graphic design legend Milton Glaser has undoubted prolificacy in the U.S. \u2014 he received the National Medal of Arts from President Obama in 2009  for his far-ranging achievements \u2014 but he has also long been active throughout Europe and Japan.  This whimsical poster was completed for the Italian office machinery manufacturer Olivetti in 1976, the same year the designer produced his soon-to-be-famed I Love New York logo.  Historical art references are absorbed into the poster featuring the world\u2019s first portable single element electric typewriter: Olivetti\u2019s Lexikon 83 DL.  Distinguished by a rapidly rotating ball imprinted with letters and symbols, Glaser was compelled to animate this defining component by adorning colorful balls with Renaissance-inspired wings. The advertisement\u2019s design provides a visual unity to the product, further emphasizing its lightness and portability. A central and recurring interest to Glaser is this exploration between the real and unreal. Here, he brings a hand-drawn quality that blurs fine art with commercial graphic arts to strengthen Olivetti\u2019s reputation for original and sophisticated products internationally.",
