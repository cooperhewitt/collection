    "description": "Eight pieces, in irregular shapes, of resist-printed cotton, with a design in blue on a white ground.  Under the leafy branches of a large tree appear two Chinoiserie scenes. In one, a line of figures in Chinese costume appears: a man with crude plow, a man arranging flowers in vase, a man playing a wind instrument, a man behind a table with a fly whisk, a man in large hat with his hand upraised, and a woman with flower standing before a pavilion in which is seated a man in wide hat.  In the other, two hunters with bows and arrows are pursuing an ostrich and a stag.  Chinese pavilions appear in the background.  Two cows are probably associated with man with the plow.  Above these scenes, the broad limbs of the tree stretch from left to right; in them appear a monkey and a squirrel.  \nThe design is decorated throughout with lines of white dots, either emphasizing line of growth of leaves or form of a dress, or added as extra decoration.  In the island, supporting the scenes, there are curved lines of dots, of decorative character, following the lines of these islands.",
