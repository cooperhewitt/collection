    "description": "The present view of a room installation featured in a Metropolitan Museum exhibition shows a central and two lateral tiled walls on a tiled floor. The tiles, in a foliate pattern, are arranged in five horizontal rows on the walls and three on the floor. A niche is centered on two vertical rows of tile in the back wall and placed between the floor and the top of the third level of tiles. A full length mirror within; glass shelf across; and stoppered, glass perfume bottles and tasseled boxes placed on the shelf comprise the vanity. A curved, tufted bench, also tasseled, sits on the floor in front of the vanity. Hanging above the vanity, a chandelier of curved, blown glass strips and narrow, fluorescent bulbs located in a central core, completes the design.",
