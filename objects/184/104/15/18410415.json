    "description":"The present object, a dispenser for absorbent cotton, is designed in a round or ovoid shape with a hole centered in the top, underneath the lid, through which the cotton protrudes. In the black and white photograph, which uses highlights and shadows to enhance the object, the dispenser is positioned on the left and the lid in the bottom right corner; both are in partial view. The packaging label, also in partial view, encases the outside of the dispenser and folds over the rim to the inside. A thick black band, punctuating the background from top to bottom, is itself intersected in the top half by three horizontal thin, white lines encircling the entire label. The [hand-lettered up-and-down script style]\/ Cotton\/ Picker [serif-style capitals] is imprinted above the uppermost band and in between the middle and bottom bands; Bauer\/ &\/ Black is imprinted just above the bottom rim of the dispenser. To the right of the band, three pairs of miniscule dots appear above and below the lines.",
