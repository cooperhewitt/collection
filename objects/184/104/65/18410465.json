    "description": "A thick black border encases a rust-colored ground. Four dagger-like objects, imprinted in gilt, each ending in five balls of gradually diminishing size, are centered at the top, beginning at the outer edge of the border and extending briefly into the ground. Color plates\/ of\/ Gulistan\/ and other Karagheusian\/ Rugs fills most of the remaining space within the ground; Gulistan is imprinted in white, stencil-style letters, and the remaining copy is imprinted in a hand-lettered style upright script in gilt. The four \"daggers\" are repeated in reverse, beginning within the ground and ending at the outer edge of the lower border.",
