    "description": "The present black and white photograph displays an unidentified object, perhaps a radiator or plumbing fixture, fabricated of a ceramic material. A roller (?) is inserted in two ribbed ceramic end pieces. A protruding attachment with a metal base and ceramic handle is inserted in the end piece located on the right. A partly flat-surfaced and partly ribbed ceramic structure, perhaps attached to a frame, appears behind. Light is reflected in the ceramic ribs; deep shadows form in the background.",
