    "description": "In the present black and white photograph, a box designed to contain stationery is positioned on the diagonal and occupies most of the page. Swirly foliate forms comprise the all-over pattern on the top and sides of the box. In the upper right hand corner, a black rectangle is imprinted in its lower half, left margin justified, in white serif style capitals, Eaton's\/ Highland\/ Linen. The box casts a dark shadow on the left and is reflected in the lower front and right side of the background, probably a glass or plastic surface.",
