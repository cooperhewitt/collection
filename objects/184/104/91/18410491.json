    "description": "In the present photograph, three dimensional models and graphics comprise a display of Danish agricultural products in a pavilion. In a three-sided, glass fronted, electrically lighted case on the right, dolls in Danish costumes, probably representing such products and their geographical origins within Denmark, are mounted on the back wall, flanking an agricultural map of Denmark. Abutting the case on the left, a panel, not enclosed by glass, depicts agricultural exports through illustration and type. At the top, a cornice is labeled Denmark Agricultural Products on the long side; Denmark is repeated on the short side. Flower boxes are placed in a row on the floor immediately in front of the pavilion.",
