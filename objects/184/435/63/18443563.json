    "gallery_text": "In preparation for the festivities of Carnival in 1748, a group of students at the French Academy in Rome devised to dress collectively as Turkish men traveling in a sultan\u2019s caravan to Mecca. The pensionnaires crafted homemade costumes, painting linen to resemble sumptuous brocades and hung oversized turbans with faux pearls and feathers. The fantastic outfits were modeled after sets of prints illustrating figures in exotic dress, including Bonnarts\u2019 Costumes du r\u00e8gne de Louis XIV, and Vanmour\u2019s Recueil. Images of people living in the Ottoman Empire were popular in France; two years before Vien\u2019s departure for Rome, the embassy of Mahmen Said Effendi visited the French capital, igniting the fashion for turquerie. \n \nJoseph-Marie Vien had a tremendous aptitude for etching, demonstrated by the ambitious set of thirty-two plates he made to record the student\u2019s masquerade costumes. He created the etchings by using a metal stylus to draw onto the surface of a copper plate that had been covered in a preparatory ground. The plate was then immersed in acid, which corroded the areas of metal left exposed by the tool\u2019s marks. The result was a richly textured image with the spontaneous lines of a drawing that could be produced in multiples. Etchings were an affordable way for artists to distribute their work and build their reputation. \n \nDespite its popularity and demanding technique, the medium of etching was not recognized by the academy as a legitimate artistic practice. The institution maintained rigid hierarchies of genre and media, with printmakers occupying the lowest rank. Vien petitioned the academy to allow printmakers to apply for the prestigious Prix de Rome, which provided artist, generally painters and sculptors, the opportunity to study in Rome, but the policy was not changed until \n1803.",
