    "description":"The facial outline emphasizes the cheekbones, depicted in curves from eye-level downward at the outer edges. The outline is unfinished at the top. On either side of the face, underneath a headdress suggested by a few vertical lines, curly hair appears at the top of the forehead, disappears at eyebrow-level, and reappears just above chin level, where it cascades downward, ending below the neck. The subject looks straight ahead from wide-open, pale eyes under straight brows. The nose is depicted in a barely visible vertical line and darker nostrils. A dark line separates top from bottom in the depiction of the closed lips.",
