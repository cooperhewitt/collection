    "description":"The present square-shaped, heavy-jowled head is topped by curlicues of hair. Two furrows in the center of the forehead describe a frowning expression. The eyebrows rise sharply upward on both sides of the furrows. Closed eyes, and a thin line depicting the lips under an additional curlicue representing a moustache, exacerbate the disagreeable expression.  To the right are a capital A and, in script, an additional incomplete letter (S?)\/ Ima(incomplete g).",
