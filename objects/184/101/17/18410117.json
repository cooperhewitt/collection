    "description":"The right-profiled head of a female with a long neck is slanted downward from right to left and centered in the upper half of the page. The direction changes in the torso, so that the body, cut off at the waist, is placed on the diagonal from left to right. A full head of shoulder length hair is trimmed in ringlets edging the face. The eye is cast downward, while the eyebrow slants upward toward the slightly tilted nose; shading appears under the lips and along the chin line. Rounded shoulders end in abbreviated arms. A scalloped neckline and suggestion of a strapless bodice complete the design.",
