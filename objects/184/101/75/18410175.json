    "description": "In the upper half of the page on the right, the profile of a female head tilted upward is depicted in dark outline. The eye, barely visible in the upper left hand corner of its socket, glances upward under a curved eyebrow. Broken curves comprising the hair frame the face above an earring and continue over the top and back of the head. Four lines of indecipherable script fill the space to the right.\n\nDirectly below the first head, a second, probably female and positioned on shoulders, resembles the first. Here, however, a heavy black wash appears outside the profile outline and shading is used on the face and neck. A thick head of shoulder length hair erupts in wavy tendrils framing the face. A series of curves across the shoulders suggests a garment.\n\nVarious capital letters, for example, C, G, S, and W are scattered on the page, and a price quotation, $28.22, appears to the left of the second head.",
