    "description": "Reproduction of a broadside reading, \n\"Illustration of Manufacturing Celerity to prove the possibility of WOOL being manufactured into CLOTH and made into a COAT between SUNRISE and SUNSET and which was successfully accomplished on Tuesday the 25th of June, 1811. At five o'clock that morning TWO SHEEP belonging to Sir John Throckmorton, Bart. were sheared by his own shepherd FRANCIS Druett and the wool given to Mr. JOHN COXETER at Greenham Mills near NEWBURY, BERKSHIRE: who had the WOOL spun, the YARN spooled, warped, loomed, and wove. The CLOTH burned, milled, rowed, dyed, dryed, sheared and pressed BY FOUR O'CLOCK - ALL the processes of MANUFACTURE were performed BY HAND in ELEVEN HOURS. THE CLOTH was then given to Mr. ISSAC WHITE, Tailor, of Newbury, whose Son, James White, cut the coat out and had it made up within TWO HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES, when the Master Manufacturers, Mr. John Coxeter, presented it to Sir John Throckmorton, Bast. who appeared with it before an assembly of 5000 spectators who had come far and near to witness this singular and uprecedented performance completed in THIRTEEN HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES.\nTHE THROCKMORTON COAT of Coughton Court\"",
