The gold thread is couched on, to produce the main body of the design, and is outlined in red silk, in part of the piece, then pale pink silk. Metal-wrapped silk couched by silk of various colors, padded couching, couched loops of metal-wrapped silk, attached coils of flat metal strips. Metallic yarns are couched in pairs for large dense areas, two plied Z for outlines, and two plied Z and re-plied S for outer border.",
