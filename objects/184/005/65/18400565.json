    "description":"Design shows a stiffly curving stylized vine through which move a lion pursuing a youth, a cupid (?) blindfolded with bow and arrow, a dragon, and birds. The gold thread is couched on, to produce the main body of the design, and is outlined in red silk, in part of the piece, then pale pink silk. Metal-wrapped silk couched by silk of various colors, padded couching, couched loops of metal-wrapped silk, attached coils of flat metal strips. Metallic yarns are couched in pairs for large dense areas, two plied Z for outlines, and two plied Z and re-plied S for outer border.",
