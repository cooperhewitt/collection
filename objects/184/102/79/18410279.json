    "description":"The source of the chiseled appearance of the head is ancient Roman sculpture; the features look carved rather than drawn. The dark line depicting the upper lip of the closed mouth, along with the furrowed forehead and thickly applied crayon throughout, produce a confident, concerned expression. Sulla appears in capitals just above the left shoulder.",
