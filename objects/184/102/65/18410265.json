    "description":"Just to the left of center, in the top half of the page, a female figure is posed. Her head, topped by a headdress fronted by a reptile design, is turned to the left. Her left arm extends downward, away from the body, while the right bends at the elbow and points upward, ending with the hand resting on the shoulder. Lightly sketched, curves form the outlines of the breasts and lines suggest a long dress. \n\nTo the right of the figure, within a circle, is a rooster design composed of a feather-patterned, crescent-shaped body posed on thin, centered legs; repeated curves forming a tail on the right; and on the left, a beaked face topped by a crenulated form. Within the circle at the top, Avon is imprinted in capitals. \n\nBeneath the figure, just above the center of the page, Reon is imprinted, also in capitals.",
