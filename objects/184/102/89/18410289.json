    "description": "This frontal view of a man shows a thinly outlined head, balding, of an almost-square shape. The face is comprised of a broad forehead, marked by three horizontal lines; two vertical lines extending upward above the nose; and eyebrows, nose and mouth delineated by thin, dark lines. The facial surface below the eyebrows is heavily shaded. Scipio Afric, in antique Roman style capitals, appears on either side of the face just above the shoulders.",
