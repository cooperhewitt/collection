    "description":"In the top half of the page, on the left, the head of a female turns right.  With soft shading behind, articulated lines of hair spike upward from the forehead, then fall softly downward, framing the face on the left to chin level and on the right to eye level. Pale eyes, partly closed under straight brows; softly closed lips; and an upward tilt of the head contribute to a pensive, even dreamy, expression. The neck and shoulders are depicted by a few lines. \n\nUpward and to the right is a profile view, less detailed than the first and probably of the same model. Her lips smile softly, the eye is wide open and the hair consists of a few wisps at the top of the forehead.\n\nJust above the right shoulder of the woman in frontal view are the initials, in capitals, G. H.; at right angles, in vertical format, is Kmeneje, also in capitals.",
