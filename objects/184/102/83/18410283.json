    "description":"The design, alluding to ancient Greco-Roman marble statuary, is located on the page off-center to the left. The profile outline is shaded from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck. Additional shading extends the chin line leftward and demarcates the cheekbone, eye, eyelid, and brow. The hair is styled close to the head in ringlets and waves. Livia, in Roman-style capitals, is placed in the space under the chin. The designer's notation, from ancient marble, is written in script under his signature on the lower left of the page.",
