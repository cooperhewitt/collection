    "description": "In the center right, a three-quarter view of a female glancing left is heavily cross-hatched above the left eye; on the left side of the nose and cheek; and, intertwined with loosely defined curlicues of hair, over the face and neck, left, and behind the face, right. More precise curlicues frame the forehead. Heavily applied ink is used to outline the eyebrows, all parts of the eyes, the mouth, and the right side of the nose. Two additional faces, one in left profile in the upper right hand corner and one in right profile in the center left, show similar technique, but are less fully realized.\n\nDecorative motifs incorporating abstract curved and foliate forms are scattered on the page. Near the lower edge of the page, center, Resarch [sic] is imprinted in an ornate script. The letters B and R, also in script appear on the lower right of the left profile head.",
