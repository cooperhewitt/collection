    "description":"Recto: Within this square-jawed face, eyes look straight ahead under brows connected to the nose in unbroken lines on both sides. The hair, styled close to the head at the top and sides, forms ringlets at ear-level, ending at the shoulders. Foliate forms and U S A appear just above the top of the head on the left.\n\nVerso: Bauer & Black, imprinted in capitals, abuts the top edge. Two variations of B & B (adosse) in the center and to the right, and two lines of [Ba]uer & Black, underneath, complete the page.",
