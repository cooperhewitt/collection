    "description":"The source of the chiseled appearance of the head is ancient Roman sculpture; the features look carved rather than drawn. This style is supported by the use of heavy shading throughout, especially around the eye and cheekbone. The hair style, as found in ancient views of Augustus, is close-cropped with bangs, depicted by short strokes in the present drawing. August\/ Caesar appears in capitals on the lower left, just above the shoulder and beneath the chin.",
