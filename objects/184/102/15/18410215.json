    "description":"A left profile view of a woman wearing a hood occupies the center of the page. Her eye, heavily fringed, is closed. The hood extends over the hairline at the front and hangs down at the sides; the inner side framing the profile outline is shaded, while the visible outer side forms two folds. The line of the left shoulder extends outward from beneath the hood.\n\nNext to the first view, a second, less finished and also in profile, abuts the right edge of the page. Waves spring from the hairline above the forehead. The eyebrow slants sharply upward over the eye socket, in which the eyeball is barely visible in the inner corner.",
