    "description":"In the present above-the-waist view, depicted in thinly drawn outline, pale, wide-open eyes in an ovoid face look directly at the viewer, while on each side of the face a continuous curved line forms the eyebrows and nose. Semicircles outlining the nostrils, and closed lips, complete the facial features. A patch of hair on the forehead at the center and wisps at the sides of the face escape the hat. The cloche has a high, rounded crown and is brimless. The model also wears an unstructured jacket with a rolled collar over a low-necked garment.",
