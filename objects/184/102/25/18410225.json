    "description":"The present sheet shows a three quarter view of a female glancing left. The forehead and sides of the face are framed by curlicues. On the left cheek and neck, several rows of the letter l in script mingled with smudges comprise the shading. Smudges also appear above the wide open eyes, on the lips, and on the lower right behind the face. A second head, also in three quarter turning left, is rendered in a less realized, but similar, style. A third view, in right profile, is a thinly outlined rudimentary sketch.\n\nVariations of figure 8 motifs in an abstract style are scattered over the page.",
