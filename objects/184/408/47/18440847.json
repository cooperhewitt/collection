    "description": "Printed silk handkerchief with a portrait of Joseph Marie Jacquard (1752 - 1834) in the center, framed by a leafy wreath with silk cocoons and caterpillars. In each corner, an arguing couple; he is holding a reed, a roll of fabric, and a wet umbrella. On each side, a hexagonal medallion with the jacquard loom. In the border between, weaving implements. Printed in red and dark purple on a white ground.",

    "gallery_text": "In the center of his handkerchief is a portrait of Marie Louis Jacquard (1752-1834), inventor of the jacquard loom. Patented in 1804, the loom included a punch-card mechanism for controlling the action of the warp, greatly simplifying the production of complex fabrics and revolutionizing the French silk industry, symbolized by the caterpillars and cocoons nestled in the oak wreath framing the inventor\u2019s portrait. \n \nAlthough advantageous for the silk manufacturers, the mechanism threatened the livelihoods of skilled laborers, an issue illustrated by the arguing couple in each corner. The man represents the fabricant and the woman the fa\u00e7onniere, who would have used the weaving implements pictured in the border as she worked the loom. Nineteenth century newspaper accounts describe violent protests against Jacquard\u2019s invention, noting that twice Jacquard was almost drowned. One protest involved the public disassembly of a jacquard loom, \u201cthe iron[\u2026] sold for iron \u2013 the wood for wood, and he, its inventor, [\u2026] delivered over to universal ignominy.\u201d",
