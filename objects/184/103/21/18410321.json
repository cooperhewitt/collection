    "description":"The present frontal view shows a young (?) male looking straight ahead out of wide-open eyes under brows slanted upward toward the sides of the face. Full, closed lips, curved downward, along with shading of the area above the nose, produce a frowning expression. Additional shading, delicately applied, appears under the chin and jaw; and heavily applied, surrounds the top and sides of the head. Thatched hair, pale yellow in color, is combed toward the left.",
