    "description": "Recto: Heavy shading emphasizes the eyelid, and the eye turns as far as possible to the left. The nostrils, upper lip and jaw line are also emphasized. Two clusters of thin lines extend from ear-level to the corner of the lips and from ear-level to the chin. Wisps of wavy hair sweep backward from the hairline. \n\nVerso: The profile outline traces that of the recto. A defined eyebrow, light shading on the eyelid, and long, wavy lines depicting the hair differentiate the present view from the recto.",
