    "description":"An image of the Danish royal crown and an abstract-heraldic motif comprise the front cover design, depicted in raised gilt printing on off-white cardboard. The back cover is blank. The inner front and back cardboard covers in maroon form a narrow border on three sides of the outer cover. On the title program page, imprinted in script, four miniature versions of the cover design alternate with three lines of type in script: In Honor of Their Royal Highnesses\/ The Crown Prince and Crown Princess\/ of Denmark and Iceland. Four additional lines in smaller type appear underneath. On the four remaining pages, headed Menu, Program, Program and Music, capital sans-serif black type alternates with italicized red script. A tasseled silk cord secures the whole.",
