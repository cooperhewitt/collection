    "description": "The present head, in left profile, is tilted downward and supported by a long, muscular neck above broad shoulders.  Wavy lines depict the hair on the side and toward the back of the head. Similarly thick, but not wavy, lines cover the shoulders. Heavy shading is used throughout to highlight the features: cheekbones, forehead, neck, etc. Above the image, Julius\/ Caesar is drawn, again thickly, in antique Roman style letters.  Vertical lines, representing the outline of a book, border the design. Just above the bottom edge of the page, the projected colors of the finished design, imperial yellow and black, are noted in script.",
