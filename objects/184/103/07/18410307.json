    "description":"This diagonal representation of a design for a long, narrow room (or corner of a larger room) cuts away to a view of the back and left lateral walls. A foliate design, centered, hangs on the back wall; a low chest (or table) is placed on the floor directly underneath, its center section the same width as the hanging, and its side pieces raised a few inches above. A rectangular carpet with a central foliate design and geometric border extends from the back wall and underneath the chest, matching the width of the back wall and length of the room.",
