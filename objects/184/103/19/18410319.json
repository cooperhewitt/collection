    "description":"The head is turned sligthly to the right, so that only the left ear is visible. Under thick brows, the eyes, although open, are not fully drawn; heavy pouches are sketched underneath. The lips are closed. Heavy jowls, emphasized by shadows on the left and under the chin, obscure the neck. Line drawing is used to sketch in the coat and tie.",
