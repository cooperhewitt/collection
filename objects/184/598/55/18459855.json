    "description":"The image depicts a chimneypiece with four young men decorating the andirons. These men have lion paws for legs, holding garlands in one hand and a coin in the other. Behind them, a symmetrical image of a plant formation with satyrs, birds, and laurel, among other symbols. The jambs are identical and are composed of Egyptian figures in profile flanking a cross with hieroglyphs topped with a seated sphinx with its wings around a medallion depicting military symbols. The mantel depicts a cartouche with winged deities holding a vase, all bordered by vines, above a garland made up of faces.",
