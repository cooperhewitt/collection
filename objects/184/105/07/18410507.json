    "description": "The present object, a label for a round or oval package designed to dispense absorbent cotton, appears in a flattened state.\n\nThe lavender background is punctuated from top to bottom edge, at equal intervals, by three vertical, thick, black bands; and in the top half, intersecting the bands all the way across, by three horizontal thin, white lines. The (......)\/ Cotton\/ Picker (...) is imprinted above the upper band and in between the middle and bottom bands; and Bauer\/ &\/ Black is imprinted just above the bottom edge. Between the bands, in the center of each lavender area, a pair of miniscule dots appears above and below each line.",
