    "description": "A partly opened box, which appears to be fabricated of leather (exterior) and velvet (interior) is placed on the diagonal and abuts the top and bottom edges. A design, perhaps of crowns or castle spires, imprinted below Imperial in capitals, is centered on both the cover and the exposed lining; a circle of indecipherable letters rings the central image. Short straps in which snap tops are embedded extend from the cover; with the box in a closed position, these would attach to snap bottoms, one of which is visible on the lower part of the box.",
