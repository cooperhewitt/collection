    "description": "In the left half of this divided page is an illustration of a man's head in left profile posed on frontal shoulders. He wears a laurel wreath and what appears to be an armor-like garment. The forehead is lined, nose aquiline, and lips full; these and remaining facial features are heavily shaded. Both the presence of the wreath and the profile form allude to Roman coin portraiture, despite the use of the left profile in the present object rather than the right profile typical on Roman coinage. The figure is identified as Julius\/Caesar, imprinted on the upper left in capitals in an ancient Roman-style font.\n\nIn the right half, A Child's\/ History\/ of Rome is imprinted in the top half in serif-style capitals. By\/ Gordon\/ King appears underneath toward the top of the lower half, the by much smaller and the author's name slightly smaller than the type in the title.  The publisher, Doubleday & Doran, is sketched in, type undefined, near the bottom edge of the page.",
