    "description": "The head, tilted to the left, is positioned on a thick, long neck, outlined by a curved line on the left and straight one on the right. A wavy edge of hair, beginning at the left eyebrow, extending across at the top of the forehead and down the right side of the face and neck, ends at the shoulder. A rounded line following the contour of the head from the top left to the right shoulder indicates either thick hair or a long headdress. The horizontal lines of the eyebrows connect unbroken to the vertical outlines of the nose. The wide open eyes glance to the left. Shading appears under the nostrils, the thick lower lip, and the chin. A curved line below the neck indicates the shoulders.",
