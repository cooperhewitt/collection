    "description":"a) main pattern of this border consists of a band of alternating vertical leaves and arrow heads connected at the base by a system of curls. Three stripes run along the upper edge, while the lower edge is banded by a string of pointed ellipses connected by round beads. Each \"ellipse\"is outlined in dots and contains a sprig that points in the opposite direction of its neighbor. Printed in greens, gray, white, mustard and mauve on a black background; b) a narrow band superimposed over \"13-a\". Border consists of a cable pattern with two different, alternating segments: one with serrated highlights, and the other with rows of dots and stripes. Printed in greens, white and gray on black; c) A later superimposition of \"19-a\". This border consists of a continuous horizontal branch wrapped around in foliage, more naturalistic than the underlying border. Printed in rust, browns, yellow, ochre, light and dark green and black; d) Companion to \"13-a\". Consists of a temple set into a landscape, flanked by a palm-like tree and a pine, alternating with a long-tailed bird around which rose branches have been arranged.",
