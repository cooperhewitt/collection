The back cover has a central design of two ovals with the left framing the initials: CAR. The right has St. Martin on horseback about to cut his throat for a half-naked beggar. These figures are worked in colored silks and metal thread. The ovals are surmounted by a coronet in gold and colored silks. Same border decoration as the front. Lined with printed end paper in a floral design of red, yellow and brown.",
