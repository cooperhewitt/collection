Asia is depicted as a man seated on a camel carrying an open parasol, and behind him an ape plays with a butterfly. Europe is a seated, helmeted female resting her hand on a shield, on which appears a horse. Other attributes include: flags, trumpet, anchor, caduceus, and cornucopia. Africa appears as two men in plumed turbans spearing lions. America is represented by seated Indians, in high feather headdress, carrying a bow and playing with a parrot. Based on designs by Joseph Bourne and Pascal Picart.",
