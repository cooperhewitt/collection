    "description":"Horizontal rectangular panel with a gold metallic ground and polychrome silk velvet figures of four women separated by large flowering plants. From left to right: a woman holding a long-necked jar in one hand while the other holds up her skirt, in which she has gathered fruits; a woman holding a pitcher in one hand and cradling a large bowl or basin in the other; a woman wearing gloves, holding a bird of prey in her left hand while about to hood the bird with her right; a woman with a long stick with which she is prodding a hound held by a lead in her right hand; the hound is straining the lead. Two of the flowering plants grow at the edge of ponds, one rests on a cloud form and the other grows among the rocks. The iris, carnation, and poppy are recognizable. Clouds and butterflies dot the sky. In shades of blue, green, yellow, reds, and neutral and flesh tones on a gold metallic ground. Slightly more than one unit of the repeat is present; the pattern fills the width of the fabric and is oriented perpendicular to the warp.",
