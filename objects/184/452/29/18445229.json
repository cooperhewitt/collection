    "gallery_text": "Throughout the 18th century, the waistcoat was one of the most elaborately decorated components of a man\u2019s outfit. It was usually worn as a part of the habit \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, an early form of the three-piece suit, which included a waistcoat, similar to a vest, a coat (habit), and breeches. This outfit was appropriate for formal and some informal social occasions. At this point in the century, the waistcoat extended to the level of the hips, and often did not match the other elements of the outfit. \nThis uncut embroidered panel includes two fronts, attached pocket flaps, button covers, and the collar and lapels in the upper corners. The waistcoat would have been purchased in this form from an embroidery workshop, and a tailor would cut out the pieces and assemble and line the finished product to order. The playful design features various exotic plants and flowers and monkeys drinking rum and playing music. The popular theme of monkeys assuming human roles, called singerie (monkey trick), was part of the 18th-century vogue for imaginary and exotic representations of the distant eastern world.",
