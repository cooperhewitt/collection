    "description": "A narrow-woven sample of a fabric called alaari, which is made from spun waste silk, combined with locally grown, hand-spun cotton. Violet ground with a green stripe in the center, flanked by narrow ikat stripes of dark and light blue. Violet warp is silk, green and indigo strips are cotton, and the weft is black cotton.",

    "gallery_text": "Alaari, along with etu and sanyan, are the three most prestigious and deeply traditional Yoruban cloths. Alaari is made from waste silk \u2013 the short fibers remaining on the silk cocoon after the continuous filament has been reeled -- which must be spun. These waste fibers originated in southern Europe, were dyed in North Africa, and transported along trans-Saharan caravan routes to Kano and other West African trading centers.  Magenta was the favored color; the dye is believed to be cochineal-based. \nOccasionally all-silk fabrics were made, but usually the silk was used in combination with locally grown cotton, where the silk is used as warp stripes or as supplementary weft patterning. This example, with its deep violet color and subtle ikat stripe, is considered to be cloth of the very highest quality.",
