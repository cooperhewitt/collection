In the 1830s, skirts became wider and shorter, making the ankle and foot a new focal point. Colored shoes worn with embellished stockings became increasingly fashionable at this time. It is believed these slippers were worn by Catherine Elizabeth Van Cortlandt when she was a young woman, possibly during her courtship with Pierre Van Cortlandt III.\nCatherine Elizabeth Van Cortlandt lived at  Manor House in Croton-on-Hudson, New York after she married Pierre Van Cortlandt III in 1836. He was a descendant of an influential New York family with Dutch origins extending back to the 17th century. The home received National Historic Landmark status in 1961 and is now known as Van Cortlandt Manor House.",
